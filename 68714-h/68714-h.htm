<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The history of the Sabbath embraces the period of 6000
years. The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord. The
acts which constituted it such were, first, the example of the
Creator; secondly, his placing his blessing upon the day;
and thirdly, the sanctification or divine appointment of the
day to a holy use. The Sabbath, therefore, dates from the
beginning of our world’s history. The first who Sabbatized
on the seventh day is God the Creator; and the first seventh
day of time is the day which he thus honored. The highest
of all possible honors does, therefore, pertain to the seventh
day. Nor is this honor confined to the first seventh day of
time; for so soon as God had rested upon that day, he appointed
the seventh day to a holy use, that man might hallow
it in memory of his Creator.</p>

<p>This divine appointment grows out of the nature and fitness
of things, and must have been made directly to Adam,
for himself and wife were then the only beings who had the
days of the week to use. As it was addressed to Adam while
yet in his uprightness, it must have been given to him as the
head of the human family. The fourth commandment bases
all its authority upon this original mandate of the Creator,
and must, therefore, be in substance what God commanded
to Adam and Eve as the representatives of mankind.</p>

<p>The patriarchs could not possibly have been ignorant of
the facts and the obligation which the fourth commandment
shows to have originated in the beginning, for Adam was
present with them for a period equal to more than half the
Christian dispensation. Those, therefore, who walked with
God in the observance of his commandments did certainly
hallow his Sabbath.</p>

<p>The observers of the seventh day must therefore include
the ancient godly patriarchs, and none will deny that they
include also the prophets and the apostles. Indeed, the entire
church of God embraced within the records of inspiration
were Sabbath-keepers. To this number must be added
the Son of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span></p>

<p>What a history, therefore, has the Sabbath of the Lord!
It was instituted in Paradise, honored by several miracles
each week for the space of forty years, proclaimed by the
great Law-giver from Sinai, observed by the Creator, the patriarchs,
the prophets, the apostles, and the Son of God!
It constitutes the very heart of the law of God, and so long
as that law endures, so long shall the authority of this sacred
institution stand fast.</p>

<p>Such being the record of the seventh day, it may well be
asked, How came it to pass that this day has been abased to
the dust, and another day elevated to its sacred honors?
The Scriptures nowhere attribute this work to the Son of
God. They do, however, predict the great apostasy in the
Christian church, and that the little horn, or man of sin, the
lawless one, should think to change times and laws.</p>

<p>It is the object of the present volume to show, 1. The Bible
record of the Sabbath; 2. The record of the Sabbath in
secular history; 3. The record of the Sunday festival, and
of the several steps by which it has usurped the place of the
ancient Sabbath.</p>

<p>The writer has attempted to ascertain the exact truth in
the case by consulting the original authorities as far as it
has been possible to gain access to them. The margin will
show to whom he is mainly indebted for the facts presented
in this work, though it indicates only a very small part of
the works consulted. He has given the exact words of the
historians, and has endeavored, conscientiously, to present
them in such a light as to do justice to the authors quoted.</p>

<p>It is not the fault of the writer that the history of the
Sunday festival presents such an array of frauds and of iniquities
in its support. These are, in the nature of the case,
essential to its very existence, for the claim of a usurper is
necessarily based in fraud. The responsibility for these rests
with those who dare commit or uphold such acts. The ancient
Sabbath of the Lord has never needed help of this kind,
and never has its record been stained by fraud or falsehood.</p>

<h1>HISTORY OF THE SABBATH.</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PART_I_BIBLE_HISTORY">PART I—BIBLE HISTORY.</h2>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CREATION.</span></h3>

<p>Time and eternity—The Creator and his work—Events of
the first day of time—Of the second—Of the third—Of the
fourth—Of the fifth—Of the sixth.</p>

</div>

<p>Time, as distinguished from eternity, may be
defined as that part of duration which is measured
by the Bible. From the earliest date in the book
of Genesis to the resurrection of the unjust at the
end of the millennium, the period of about 7000
years is measured off.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Before the commencement
of this great week of time, duration without
beginning fills the past; and at the expiration
of this period, unending duration opens before
the people of God. Eternity is that word
which embraces duration without beginning and
without end. And that Being whose existence
comprehends eternity, is he who only hath immortality,
the King eternal, immortal, invisible,
the only wise God.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>When it pleased this infinite Being, he gave existence
to our earth. Out of nothing God created<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
all things;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “so that things which are seen were
not made of things which do appear.” This act
of creation is that event which marks the commencement
of the first week of time. He who
could accomplish the whole work with one word
chose rather to employ six days, and to accomplish
the result by successive steps. Let us trace
the footsteps of the Creator from the time when
he laid the foundation of the earth until the close
of the sixth day, when the heavens and the earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
were finished, “and God saw everything that he
had made, and behold, it was very good.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>On the first day of time God created the
heaven and the earth. The earth thus called into
existence was without form, and void; and total
darkness covered the Creator’s work. Then “God
said, Let there be light; and there was light.”
“And God divided the light from the darkness,”
and called the one day, and the other night.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>On the second day of time “God said, Let
there be a firmament [margin, Heb., expansion] in
the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters
from the waters.” The dry land had not yet
appeared; consequently the earth was covered
with water. As no atmosphere existed, thick vapors
rested upon the face of the water; but the
atmosphere being now called into existence by
the word of the Creator, causing those elements
to unite which compose the air we breathe, the
fogs and vapors that had rested upon the bosom
of the water were borne aloft by it. This atmosphere
or expansion is called heaven.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>On the third day of time God gathered the
waters together and caused the dry land to appear.
The gathering together of the waters
God called seas; the dry land, thus rescued from
the waters, he called earth. “And God said, Let
the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after his
kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and
it was so.” “And God saw that it was good.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>On the fourth day of time “God said, Let
there be lights in the firmament of the heaven,
to divide the day from the night; and let them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and
years.” “And God made two great lights; the
greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light
to rule the night; he made the stars also.” Light
had been created on the first day of the week; and
now on the fourth day he causes the sun and
moon to appear as light-bearers, and places the
light under their rule. And they continue unto
this day according to his ordinances, for all are
his servants. Such was the work of the fourth
day. And the Great Architect, surveying what
he had wrought, pronounced it good.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>On the fifth day of time “God created great
whales, and every living creature that moveth,
which the waters brought forth abundantly, after
their kind, and every winged fowl after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>On the sixth day of time “God made the
beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after
their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the
earth after his kind: and God saw that it was
good.” Thus the earth, having been fitted for the
purpose, was filled with every order of living creature,
while the air and waters teemed with animal
existence. To complete this noble work of creation,
God next provides a ruler, the representative
of himself, and places all in subjection under him.
“And God said, Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness: and let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all
the earth, and over every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth.” “And the Lord God
formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
a living soul. And the Lord God planted
a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the
man whom he had formed. And out of the
ground made the Lord God to grow every tree
that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food;
the tree of life also in the midst of the garden,
and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.”
Last of all, God created Eve, the mother of all
living. The work of the Creator was now complete.
“The heavens and the earth were finished,
and all the host of them.” “And God saw everything
that he had made, and behold, it was very
good.” Adam and Eve were in paradise; the
tree of life bloomed on earth; sin had not entered
our world, and death was not here, for there was
no sin. “The morning stars sang together, and
all the sons of God shouted for joy.” Thus
ended the sixth day.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE INSTITUTION OF THE SABBATH.</span></h3>

<p>Event on the seventh day—Why the Creator rested—Acts by
which the Sabbath was made—Time and order of their
occurrence—Meaning of the word <i>sanctified</i>—The fourth
commandment refers the origin of the Sabbath to creation—The
second mention of the Sabbath confirms this fact—The
Saviour’s testimony—When did God sanctify the seventh
day—Object of the Author of the Sabbath—Testimony
of Josephus and of Philo—Negative argument from the
book of Genesis considered—Adam’s knowledge of the Sabbath
not difficult to be known by the patriarchs.</p>

</div>

<p>The work of the Creator was finished, but the
first week of time was not yet completed. Each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of the six days had been distinguished by the
Creators work upon it; but the seventh was
rendered memorable in a very different manner.
“And on the seventh<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> day God ended his work
which he had made; and he rested on the seventh
day from all his work which he had made.”
In yet stronger language it is written: “On the
seventh day he rested, and was <span class="smcap">refreshed</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Thus the seventh day of the week became the
rest-day of the Lord. How remarkable is this
fact! “The everlasting God, the Lord, the
Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not,
neither is weary.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He needed no rest; yet it is
written, “On the seventh day he rested, and was
refreshed.” Why does not the record simply
state the cessation of the Creator’s work? Why
did he at the close of that work employ a day in
rest? The answer will be learned from the next
verse. He was laying the foundation of a divine
institution, the memorial of his own great work.</p>

<p>“And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified
it; <i>because</i> that in it he had rested from all
his work which God created and made.” The
fourth commandment states the same fact: He
“rested the seventh day; <i>wherefore</i> the Lord
blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>The blessing and sanctification of the seventh
day were because that God had rested upon it.
His resting upon it, then, was to lay the foundation
for blessing and sanctifying the day. His
being refreshed with this rest, implies that he
delighted in the act which laid the foundation
for the memorial of his great work.</p>

<p>The second act of the Creator in instituting this
memorial was to place his blessing upon the day
of his rest. Thenceforward it was the blessed
rest-day of the Lord. A third act completes the
sacred institution. The day already blessed of
God is now, last of all, sanctified or hallowed by
him. To sanctify is “to separate, set apart, or
appoint to a holy, sacred, or religious use.” To
hallow is “to make holy; to consecrate; to set
apart for a holy or religious use.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The time when these three acts were performed
is worthy of especial notice. The first act was
that of rest. This took place on the seventh day;
for the day was employed in rest. The second
and third acts took place when the seventh day
was past. “God blessed the seventh day, and
sanctified it: because that in it he <i>had</i> rested
from all his work.” Hence it was on the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
day of the second week of time that God blessed
the seventh day, and set it apart to a holy use.
The blessing and sanctification of the seventh
day, therefore, relate not to the first seventh day
of time, but to the seventh day of the week for
time to come, in memory of God’s rest on that
day from the work of creation.</p>

<p>With the beginning of time, God began to
count days, giving to each an ordinal number for
its <i>name</i>. Seven <i>different</i> days receive as many
different <i>names</i>. In memory of that which he
did on the last of these days, he sets that day
apart by <i>name</i> to a holy use. This act gave existence
to weeks, or periods of seven days. For
with the seventh day, he ceased to count, and, by
the divine appointment of that day to a holy
use in memory of his rest thereon, he causes man
to begin the count of a new week so soon as the
first seventh day had ceased. And as God has
been pleased to give man, <i>in all</i>, but <i>seven</i>
different days, and has given to each one of these
days a name which indicates its exact place in
the week, his act of setting apart one of these
by name, which act created weeks and gave man
the Sabbath, can never—except by sophistry—be
made to relate to an indefinite or uncertain
day.</p>

<p>The days of the week are measured off by the
revolution of <i>our earth</i> on its axis; and hence
our seventh day, as such, can come only to dwellers
on this globe. To Adam and Eve, therefore,
as inhabitants of this earth, and not to the inhabitants
of some other world, were the days of
the week given to use. Hence, when God set
apart one of these days to a holy use in memory
of his own rest on that day of the week, the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
essence of the act consisted in his telling Adam
that this day should be used only for sacred purposes.
Adam was then in the garden of God,
placed there by the Creator to dress it and to
keep it. He was also commissioned of God to
subdue the earth.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> When therefore the rest-day
of the Lord should return, from week to week, all
this secular employment, however proper in itself,
must be laid aside, and the day observed in
memory of the Creator’s rest.</p>

<p>Dr. Twisse quotes Martin Luther thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And Martin Luther professeth as much (tome vi. in
Gen. 2:3). ‘It follows from hence,’ saith he, ‘that, if
Adam had stood in his innocency, yet he should have
kept the seventh day holy, that is, on that day he should
have taught his children, and children’s children, what
was the will of God, and wherein his worship did consist;
he should have praised God, given thanks, and offered.
On other days he should have tilled his ground, looked
to his cattle.’”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Hebrew verb, <i>kadash</i>, here rendered <i>sanctified</i>,
and in the fourth commandment rendered
<i>hallowed</i>, is defined by Gesenius, “To pronounce
holy, to sanctify; to institute any holy thing, to
appoint.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is repeatedly used in the Old Testament
for a public appointment or proclamation.
Thus, when the cities of refuge were set apart in
Israel, it is written: “They appointed [margin,
Heb., sanctified] Kedesh in Galilee in Mount
Naphtali, and Shechem in Mount Ephraim,” &amp;c.
This sanctification or appointment of the cities of
refuge was by a public announcement to Israel
that these cities were set apart for that purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
This verb is also used for the appointment of a
public fast, and for the gathering of a solemn
assembly. Thus it is written: “Sanctify [<i>i. e.</i>,
appoint] ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather
the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into
the house of the Lord your God.” “Blow the
trumpet in Zion, sanctify [<i>i. e.</i>, appoint] a fast,
call a solemn assembly.” “And Jehu said, Proclaim
[margin, Heb., sanctify] a solemn assembly
for Baal.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This appointment for Baal was so
public that all the worshipers of Baal in all Israel
were gathered together. These fasts and solemn
assemblies were sanctified or set apart by a public
appointment or proclamation of the fact. When
therefore God set apart the seventh day to a holy
use, it was necessary that he should state that fact
to those who had the days of the week to use.
Without such announcement the day could not
be set apart from the others.</p>

<p>But the most striking illustration of the meaning
of this word may be found in the record of
the sanctification of Mount Sinai.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> When God
was about to speak the ten commandments in the
hearing of all Israel, he sent Moses down from
the top of Mount Sinai to restrain the people from
touching the mount. “And Moses said unto the
Lord, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai;
for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about
the mount, and <i>sanctify it</i>.” Turning back to the
verse where God gave this charge to Moses, we
read: “And thou shalt set bounds unto the people
round about, <i>saying</i>, Take heed to yourselves,
that ye go not up into the mount or touch the
border of it.” Hence to sanctify the mount was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
to command the people not to touch even the
border of it; for God was about to descend in
majesty upon it. In other words, to sanctify or
set apart to a holy use Mount Sinai, was to tell
the people that God would have them treat the
mountain as sacred to himself. And thus also to
sanctify the rest-day of the Lord was to tell Adam
that he should treat the day as holy to the Lord.</p>

<p>The declaration, “God blessed the seventh day,
and sanctified it,” is not indeed a commandment
for the observance of that day; but it is the record
that such a precept was given to Adam.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> For
how could the Creator “set apart to a holy use”
the day of his rest, when those who were to use
the day knew nothing of his will in the case?
Let those answer who are able.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>This view of the record in Genesis we shall
find to be sustained by all the testimony in the
Bible relative to the rest-day of the Lord. The
facts which we have examined are the basis of
the fourth commandment. Thus spake the great
Law-giver from the summit of the flaming mount:
“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”
“The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God.” “For in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord
blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The term Sabbath is transferred from the Hebrew
language, and signifies rest.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The command,
“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,” is
therefore exactly equivalent to saying, “Remember
the rest-day, to keep it holy.” The explanation
which follows sustains this statement: “The
seventh day is the Sabbath [or rest-day] of the
Lord thy God.” The origin of this rest-day is
given in these words: “For in six days the Lord
made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in
them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed
it.” That which is enjoined in the fourth commandment
is to keep holy the rest-day of the
Lord. And this is defined to be the day on which
he rested from the work of creation. Moreover,
the fourth commandment calls the seventh day
the Sabbath day at the time when God blessed
and hallowed that day; therefore the Sabbath is
an institution dating from the foundation of the
world. The fourth commandment points back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the creation for the origin of its obligation; and
when we go back to that point, we find the substance
of the fourth commandment given to
Adam: “God blessed the seventh day and sanctified
it;” <i>i. e.</i>, set it apart to a holy use. And
in the commandment itself, the same fact is stated:
“The Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed
it;” <i>i. e.</i>, appointed it to a holy use. The
one statement affirms that “God blessed the seventh
day, and sanctified it;” the other, that “the
Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”
These two statements refer to the same acts.
Because the word Sabbath does not occur in the
first statement, it has been contended that the
Sabbath did not originate at creation, it being
the seventh day merely which was hallowed.
From the second statement, it has been contended
that God did not bless the seventh day at all, but
simply the Sabbath institution. But both statements
embody all the truth. God blessed the
seventh day, and sanctified it; and this day thus
blessed and hallowed was his holy Sabbath, or
rest-day. Thus the fourth commandment establishes
the origin of the Sabbath at creation.</p>

<p>The second mention of the Sabbath in the Bible
furnishes a decisive confirmation of the testimonies
already adduced. On the sixth day of the
week, Moses, in the wilderness of Sin, said to Israel,
“To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath
unto the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> What had been done to the
seventh day since God blessed and sanctified it as
his rest-day in paradise? Nothing. What did
Moses do to the seventh day to make it the rest
of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord? Nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Moses on the sixth day simply states the fact
that the morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath
unto the Lord. The seventh day had been such
ever since God blessed and hallowed the day of
his rest.</p>

<p>The testimony of our divine Lord relative to
the origin and design of the Sabbath is of peculiar
importance. He is competent to testify, for
he was with the Father in the beginning of the
creation.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> “The Sabbath was made for man,”
said he, “not man for the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The following
grammatical rule is worthy of notice: “A
noun without an adjective is invariably taken in
its broadest extension, as: Man is accountable.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The following texts will illustrate this rule, and
also this statement of our Lord’s: “Man lieth
down and riseth not: till the heavens be no more,
they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their
sleep.” “There hath no temptation taken you
but such as is common to man.” “It is appointed
unto men once to die.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In these texts man
is used without restriction, and, therefore, all
mankind are necessarily intended. The Sabbath
was therefore made for the whole human family,
and consequently originated with mankind. But
the Saviour’s language is even yet more emphatic
in the original: “The Sabbath was made for <span class="smcap">the</span>
man, not <span class="smcap">the</span> man for the Sabbath.” This language
fixes the mind on the man Adam, who was
made of the dust of the ground just before the
Sabbath was made for him, of the seventh day.</p>

<p>This is a striking confirmation of the fact already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
pointed out that the Sabbath was given to
Adam, the head of the human family.</p>

<p>“The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God; yet he made the Sabbath for man.
God made the Sabbath his by solemn appropriation,
that he might convey it back to us under
the guarantee of a divine charter, that none
might rob us of it with impunity.”</p>

<p>But is it not possible that God’s act of blessing
and sanctifying the seventh day did not occur at
the close of the creation week? May it not be
mentioned then because God designed that the
day of his rest should be afterward observed? Or
rather, as Moses wrote the book of Genesis long
after the creation, might he not insert this account
of the sanctification of the seventh day with the
record of the first week, though the day itself
was sanctified in his own time?</p>

<p>It is very certain that such an interpretation
of the record cannot be admitted, unless the facts
in the case demand it. For it is, to say the least,
a forced explanation of the language. The record
in Genesis, unless this be an exception, is a plain
narrative of events. Thus what God did on each
day is recorded in its order down to the seventh.
It is certainly doing violence to the narrative to
affirm that the record respecting the seventh day
is of a different character from that respecting
the other six. He rested the seventh day; he
sanctified the seventh day because he had rested
upon it. The reason why he should sanctify the
seventh day existed when his rest was closed.
To say, therefore, that God did not sanctify the
day at that time, but did it in the days of Moses,
is not only to distort the narrative, but to affirm
that he neglected to do that for which the reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
existed at creation, until twenty-five hundred
years after.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>But we ask that the facts be brought forward
which prove that the Sabbath was sanctified in
the wilderness of Sin, and not at creation. And
what are the facts that show this? It is confessed
that such facts are not upon record. Their
existence is assumed in order to sustain the theory
that the Sabbath originated at the fall of the
manna, and not in paradise.</p>

<p>Did God sanctify the Sabbath in the wilderness
of Sin? There is no intimation of such fact.
On the contrary, it is mentioned at that time as
something already set apart of God. On the sixth
day Moses said, “To-morrow is the rest of the
holy Sabbath unto the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Surely this is
not the act of instituting the Sabbath, but the
familiar mention of an existing fact. We pass on
to Mount Sinai. Did God sanctify the Sabbath
when he spoke the ten commandments? No one
claims that he did. It is admitted by all that
Moses spoke of it familiarly the previous month.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Does the Lord at Sinai speak of the sanctification
of the Sabbath? He does; but in the very language
of Genesis he goes back for the sanctification
of the Sabbath, not to the wilderness of Sin,
but to the creation of the world.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> We ask those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
who hold the theory under examination, this
question: If the Sabbath was not sanctified at
creation, but was sanctified in the wilderness of
Sin, why does the narrative in each instance<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> record
the sanctification of the Sabbath at creation
and omit all mention of such fact in the wilderness
of Sin? Nay, why does the record of events
in the wilderness of Sin show that the holy Sabbath
was at that time already in existence? In a
word, How can a theory subversive of all the
facts in the record, be maintained as the truth of
God?</p>

<p>We have seen the Sabbath ordained of God at
the close of the creation week. The object of its
Author is worthy of especial attention. Why
did the Creator set up this memorial in paradise?
Why did he set apart from the other days of the
week that day which he had employed in rest?
“Because that in it,” says the record, “he had
rested from all his work which God created and
made.” A <i>rest</i> necessarily implies a <i>work performed</i>.
And hence the Sabbath was ordained
of God as a memorial of the work of creation.
And therefore that precept of the moral law
which relates to this memorial, unlike every other
precept of that law, begins with the word, “Remember.”
The importance of this memorial will
be appreciated when we learn from the Scriptures
that it is the work of creation which is claimed
by its Author as the great evidence of his eternal
power and Godhead, and as that great fact which
distinguishes him from all false gods. Thus it is
written:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“He that built all things is God.” “The gods that
have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall
perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.”
“But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and
an everlasting King.” “He hath made the earth by his
power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and
hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.” “For
the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made, even his eternal power and Godhead.” “For he
spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.”
Thus “the worlds were framed by the word of God, so
that things which are seen were not made of things
which do appear.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the estimate which the Scriptures place
upon the work of creation as evincing the eternal
power and Godhead of the Creator. The Sabbath
stands as the memorial of this great work. Its
observance is an act of grateful acknowledgment
on the part of his intelligent creatures that
he is their Creator, and that they owe all to him;
and that for his pleasure they are and were created.
How appropriate this observance for Adam! And
when man had fallen, how important for his well-being
that he should “remember the Sabbath day,
to keep it holy.” He would thus have been preserved
from atheism and from idolatry; for he
could never forget that there was a God from
whom all things derived their being; nor could
he worship as God any other being than the Creator.</p>

<p>The seventh day, as hallowed by God in Eden,
was not Jewish, but divine; it was not the memorial
of the flight of Israel from Egypt, but of the
Creator’s rest. Nor is it true that the most distinguished
Jewish writers deny the primeval origin
of the Sabbath, or claim it as a Jewish memorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
We cite the historian Josephus and his
learned cotemporary, Philo Judæus. Josephus,
whose “Antiquities of the Jews” run parallel with
the Bible from the beginning, when treating of
the wilderness of Sin, makes no allusion whatever
to the Sabbath, a clear proof that he had no idea
that it originated in that wilderness. But when
giving the account of creation, he bears the following
testimony:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Moses says that in just six days the world and all that
is therein was made. And that the seventh day was a
rest and a release from the labor of such operations;
<span class="smcap">whence</span> it is that we celebrate a rest from our labor on
that day, and call it the Sabbath; which word denotes
rest in the Hebrew tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Philo bears an emphatic testimony relative
to the character of the Sabbath as a memorial.
Thus he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But after the whole world had been completed according
to the perfect nature of the number six, the Father
hallowed the day following, the seventh, praising it
and calling it holy. For that day is the festival, not of
one city or one country, but of all the earth; a day which
alone it is right to call the day of festival for all people,
and the birth-day of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor was the rest-day of the Lord a shadow of
man’s rest after his recovery from the fall. God
will ever be worshiped in an understanding manner
by his intelligent creatures. When therefore
he set apart his rest-day to a holy use, if it was
not as a memorial of his work, but as a shadow
of man’s redemption from the fall, the real design
of the institution must have been stated, and, as
a consequence, man in his unfallen state could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
never observe the Sabbath as a delight, but ever
with deep distress, as reminding him that he was
soon to apostatize from God. Nor was the holy
of the Lord and honorable, one of the “carnal
ordinances imposed on them until the time of
reformation;”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> for there could be no reformation
with unfallen beings.</p>

<p>But man did not continue in his uprightness.
Paradise was lost, and Adam was excluded from
the tree of life. The curse of God fell upon the
earth, and death entered by sin, and passed upon
all men.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> After this sad apostasy, no further
mention of the Sabbath occurs until Moses on the
sixth day said, “To-morrow is the rest of the holy
Sabbath unto the Lord.”</p>

<p>It is objected that there is no precept in the
book of Genesis for the observance of the Sabbath,
and consequently no obligation on the part
of the patriarchs to observe it. There is a defect
in this argument not noticed by those who use it.
The book of Genesis was not a rule given to the
patriarchs to walk by. On the contrary, it was
written by Moses 2500 years after creation, and
long after the patriarchs were dead. Consequently
the fact that certain precepts were not
found in Genesis is no evidence that they were
not obligatory upon the patriarchs. Thus the
book does not command men to love God with
all their hearts, and their neighbors as themselves;
nor does it prohibit idolatry, blasphemy, disobedience
to parents, adultery, theft, false witness
or covetousness. Who will affirm from this that
the patriarchs were under no restraint in these
things? As a mere record of events, written
long after their occurrence, it was not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
that the book should contain a moral code. But
had the book been given to the patriarchs as a
rule of life, it must of necessity have contained
such a code. It is a fact worthy of especial notice
that as soon as Moses reaches his own time in
the book of Exodus, the whole moral law is given.
The record and the people were then cotemporary,
and ever afterward the written law is in
the hands of God’s people, as a rule of life, and a
complete code of moral precepts.</p>

<p>The argument under consideration is unsound,
1. Because based upon the supposition that the
book of Genesis was the rule of life for the patriarchs;
2. Because if carried out it would release
the patriarchs from every precept of the moral
law except the sixth.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> 3. Because the act of
God in setting apart his rest-day to a holy use,
as we have seen, necessarily involves the fact that
he gave a precept concerning it to Adam, in
whose time it was thus set apart. And hence,
though the book of Genesis contains no precept
concerning the Sabbath, it does contain direct
evidence that such precept was given to the head
and representative of the human family.</p>

<p>After giving the institution of the Sabbath,
the book of Genesis, in its brief record of 2370
years, does not again mention it. This has been
urged as ample proof that those holy men, who,
during this period, were perfect, and walked with
God in the observance of his commandments,
statutes and laws,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> all lived in open profanation
of that day which God had blessed and set apart
to a holy use. But the book of Genesis also omits
any distinct reference to the doctrine of future
punishment, the resurrection of the body, the revelation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
of the Lord in flaming fire, and the Judgment
of the great day. Does this silence prove
that the patriarchs did not believe these great
doctrines? Does it make them any the less sacred?</p>

<p>But the Sabbath is not mentioned from Moses
to David, a period of five hundred years, during
which it was enforced by the penalty of death.
Does this prove that it was not observed during
this period?<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The jubilee occupied a very prominent
place in the typical system, yet in the whole
Bible a single instance of its observance is not recorded.
What is still more remarkable, there is
not on record a single instance of the observance
of the great day of atonement, notwithstanding
the work in the holiest on that day was the most
important service connected with the worldly
sanctuary. And yet the observance of the other
and less important festivals of the seventh month,
which are so intimately connected with the day
of atonement, the one preceding it by ten days,
the other following it in five, is repeatedly and
particularly recorded.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It would be sophistry to
argue from this silence respecting the day of
atonement, when there were so many instances
in which its mention was almost demanded, that
that day was never observed; and yet it is actually
a better argument than the similar one urged
against the Sabbath from the book of Genesis.</p>

<p>The reckoning of time by weeks is derived
from nothing in nature, but owes its existence to
the divine appointment of the seventh day to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
holy use in memory of the Lord’s rest from the
six days’ work of creation.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This period of time
is marked only by the recurrence of the sanctified
rest-day of the Creator. That the patriarchs
reckoned time by weeks and by sevens of days,
is evident from several texts.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> That they should
retain the week and forget the Sabbath by which
alone the week is marked, is not a probable conclusion.
That the reckoning of the week was
rightly kept is evident from the fact that in the
wilderness of Sin on the sixth day the people, of
their own accord, gathered a double portion of
manna. And Moses said to them, “To-morrow
is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The brevity of the record in Genesis causes us
to overlook many facts of the deepest interest.
Adam lived 930 years. How deep and absorbing
the interest that must have existed in the
human family to see the first man! To converse
with one who had himself talked with God! To
hear from his lips a description of that paradise
in which he had lived! To learn from one created
on the sixth day the wondrous events of the
creation week! To hear from his lips the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
words of the Creator when he set apart his rest-day
to a holy use! And to learn, alas! the sad
story of the loss of paradise and the tree of life!<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It was therefore not difficult for the facts respecting
the six days of creation and the sanctification
of the rest-day to be diffused among mankind
in the patriarchal age. Nay, it was impossible
that it should be otherwise, especially among
the godly. From Adam to Abraham a succession
of men—probably inspired of God—preserved
the knowledge of God upon earth. Thus Adam
lived till Lamech, the father of Noah, was 56
years of age; Lamech lived till Shem, the son of
Noah, was 93; Shem lived till Abraham was 150
years of age. Thus are we brought down to
Abraham, the father of the faithful. Of him it
is recorded that he obeyed God’s voice and kept
his charge, his commandments, his statutes, and
his laws. And of him the Most High bears the
following testimony: “I know him, that he will
command his children and his household after
him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to
do justice and judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The knowledge of
God was preserved in the family of Abraham;
and we shall next find the Sabbath familiarly
mentioned among his posterity, as an existing institution.</p>

family of Noah spared—Second apostasy of mankind in the
patriarchal age—The apostate nations left to their own
ways—The family of Abraham chosen—Separated from

</div>

<p>We are now to trace the history of divine truth
for many ages in almost exclusive connection with
the family of Abraham. That we may vindicate
the truth from the reproach of pertaining only to
the Hebrews—a reproach often urged against the
Sabbath—and justify the dealings of God with
mankind in leaving to their own ways the apostate
nations, let us carefully examine the Bible for the
reasons which directed divine Providence in the
choice of Abraham’s family as the depositaries of
divine truth.</p>

<p>The antediluvian world had been highly favored
of God. The period of life extended to each generation
was twelve-fold that of the present age of
man. For almost one thousand years, Adam, who
had conversed with God in paradise, had been
with them. Before the death of Adam, Enoch
began his holy walk of three hundred years, and
then he was translated that he should not see
death. This testimony to the piety of Enoch was
a powerful testimony to the antediluvians in behalf
of truth and righteousness. Moreover the
Spirit of God strove with mankind; but the perversity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of man triumphed over all the gracious restraints
of the Holy Spirit. “And God saw that
the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his
heart was only evil continually.” Even the sons
of God joined in the general apostasy. At last a
single family was all that remained of the worshipers
of the Most High.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Then came the deluge, sweeping the world of its
guilty inhabitants with the besom of destruction.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
So terrible a display of divine justice might well
be thought sufficient to restrain impiety for ages.
Surely the family of Noah could not soon forget
this awful lesson. But alas, revolt and apostasy
speedily followed, and men turned from God to
the worship of idols. Against the divine mandate
separating the human family into nations,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> mankind
united in one great act of rebellion in the
plain of Shinar. “And they said, Go to, let us
build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach
unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we
be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole
earth.” Then God confounded them in their impiety
and scattered them abroad from thence upon
the face of all the earth.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Men did not like to retain
God in their knowledge; wherefore God gave
them over to a reprobate mind, and suffered them
to change the truth of God into a lie, and to worship
and serve the creature rather than the Creator.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Such was the origin of idolatry and of the
apostasy of the Gentiles.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of this wide-spread apostasy one
man was found whose heart was faithful with God.
Abraham was chosen from an idolatrous family,
as the depositary of divine truth, the father of
the faithful, the heir of the world, and the friend
of God.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> When the worshipers of God were found
alone in the family of Noah, God gave up the rest
of mankind to perish in the flood. Now that the
worshipers of God are again reduced almost to a
single family, God gives up the idolatrous nations
to their own ways, and takes the family of Abraham
as his peculiar heritage. “For I know him,”
said God, “that he will command his children and
his household after him, and they shall keep the
way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
That they might preserve in the earth the knowledge
of divine truth and the memory and worship
of the Most High, they were to be a people walled
off from all mankind, and dwelling in a land of
their own. That they might thus be separated
from the heathen around, God gave to Abraham
the rite of circumcision, and afterward to his
posterity the whole ceremonial law.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> But they
could not possess the land designed for them until
the iniquity of the Amorites, its inhabitants, was
full, that they should be thrust out before them.
The horror of great darkness, and the smoking
furnace seen by Abraham in vision, foreshadowed
the iron furnace and the bitter servitude of Egypt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
The family of Abraham must go down thither.
Brief prosperity and long and terrible oppression
follow.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>At length the power of the oppressor is broken,
and the people of God are delivered. The expiration
of four hundred and thirty years from the
promise to Abraham marks the hour of deliverance
to his posterity.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The nation of Israel is
brought forth from Egypt as God’s peculiar treasure,
that he may give them his Sabbath, and his
law, and himself. The psalmist testifies that God
“brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen
with gladness: and gave them the lands of the
heathen: and they inherited the labor of the people:
that they might observe his statutes, and keep
his laws. And the Most High says, “I am the
Lord which hallow you, that brought you out of
the land of Egypt, <i>to be your God</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Not that
the commandments of God, his Sabbath and himself,
had no prior existence, nor that the people
were ignorant of the true God and his law;
for the Sabbath was appointed to a holy use before
the fall of man; and the commandments of
God, his statutes and his laws, were kept by Abraham;
and the Israelites themselves, when some
of them had violated the Sabbath, were reproved
by the question, “How long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws?”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> And as to the
Most High, the psalmist exclaims, ”Before the
mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting
to everlasting, thou art God.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> But there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
must be a formal public espousal of the people
by God, and of his law and Sabbath and himself
by the people.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> But neither the Sabbath, nor
the law, nor the great Law-giver, by their connection
with the Hebrews, became Jewish. The
Law-giver indeed became the God of Israel,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and
what Gentile shall refuse him adoration for that
reason? but the Sabbath still remained the Sabbath
of the Lord,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and the law continued to
be the law of the Most High.</p>

<p>In the month following their passage through
the Red Sea, the Hebrews came into the wilderness
of Sin. It is at this point in his narrative
that Moses for the second time mentions the sanctified
rest-day of the Creator. The people murmured
for bread:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain
bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out
and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove
them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. And it
shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as
much as they gather daily.... I have heard the
murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them,
saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye
shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am
the Lord your God. And it came to pass, that at even
the quails came up, and covered the camp; and in the
morning the dew lay round about the host. And when
the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of
the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small
as the hoar frost on the ground. And when the children
of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna; for
they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them,
This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.
This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every
man, according to the number of your persons; take ye
every man for them which are in his tents. And the
children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
less. And when they did mete it with an omer, he that
gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered
little had no lack; they gathered every man according to
his eating. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till
the morning. Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto
Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning,
and it bred worms, and stank; and Moses was wroth with
them. And they gathered it every morning, every man
according to his eating; and when the sun waxed hot, it
melted. And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they
gathered twice as much bread,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> two omers for one man;
and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath
said,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Lord: bake that which ye will bake to-day, and seethe
that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over
lay up to be kept until the morning. And they laid it
up till the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not stink,
neither was there any worm therein. And Moses said,
Eat that to-day; for to-day is a Sabbath unto the Lord:<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
to-day ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall
gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath,
in it there shall be none. And it came to pass, that there
went out some of the people on the seventh day for to
gather, and they found none. And the Lord said unto
Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments
and my laws? See, for that the Lord hath given you the
Sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the
bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let
no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the
people rested on the seventh day.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This narrative shows, 1. That God had a law
and commandments prior to the giving of the
manna. 2. That God in giving his people bread
from heaven designed to prove them respecting
his law. 3. That in this law was the holy Sabbath;
for the test relative to walking in the law
pertained directly to the Sabbath; and when
God said, “How long refuse ye to keep my commandments
and my laws?” it was the Sabbath
which they had violated. 4. That in proving the
people respecting this existing law, Moses gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
no new precept respecting the Sabbath, but remained
silent relative to the preparation for the
Sabbath until after the people, of their own accord,
had gathered a double portion on the sixth
day. 5. That by this act the people proved not
only that they were not ignorant of the Sabbath,
but that they were disposed to observe it.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> 6.
That the reckoning of the week, traces of which
appear through the patriarchal age,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> had been
rightly kept, for the people knew when the sixth
day had arrived. 7. That had there been any
doubt existing on that point, the fall of the manna
on the six days, the withholding of it on the
seventh, and the preservation of that needed for
the Sabbath over that day, must have settled
that point incontrovertibly.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> 8. That there was
no act of instituting the Sabbath in the wilderness
of Sin; for God did not then make it his
rest-day, nor did he then bless and sanctify the
day. On the contrary, the record shows that the
seventh day was already the sanctified rest-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> 9. That the obligation to observe
the Sabbath existed and was known before the
fall of the manna. For the language used implies
the existence of such an obligation, but does
not contain a new enactment until after some of
the people had violated the Sabbath. Thus God
says to Moses, “On the sixth day they shall prepare
that which they bring in,” but he does not
speak of the seventh. And on the sixth day
Moses says, “To-morrow is the rest of the holy
Sabbath unto the Lord,” but he does not command
them to observe it. On the seventh day
he says that it is the Sabbath, and that they
should find no manna in the field. “Six days ye
shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which
is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none.” But
in all this there is no precept given, yet the existence
of such a precept is plainly implied. 10.
That when some of the people violated the Sabbath
they were reproved in language which
plainly implies a previous transgression of this
precept. “How long refuse ye to keep my commandments
and my laws?” 11. And that this
rebuke of the Law-giver restrained for the time
the transgression of the people.</p>

<p>“See, for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath,
therefore he giveth you on the sixth day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the bread of two days:<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> abide ye every man in
his place, let no man go out of his place on the
seventh day.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> As a special trust, God committed
the Sabbath to the Hebrews. It was
now given them, not now made for them.
It was made for man at the close of the first
week of time; but all other nations having turned
from the Creator to the worship of idols, it is
given to the Hebrew people. Nor does this prove
that all the Hebrews had hitherto disregarded it.
For Christ uses the same language respecting circumcision.
Thus he says, “Moses therefore gave
unto you circumcision; not because it is of Moses,
but of the fathers.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Yet God had enjoined that
ordinance upon Abraham and his family four hundred
years previous to this gift of it by Moses, and
it had been retained by them.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The language, “The Lord hath given you the
Sabbath,” implies a solemn act of committing a
treasure to their trust. How was this done? No
act of instituting the Sabbath here took place.
No precept enjoining its observance was given
until some of the people violated it, when it was
given in the form of a reproof; which evinced a
previous obligation, and that they were transgressing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
an existing law. And this view is certainly
strengthened by the fact that no explanation
of the institution was given to the people; a
fact which indicates that some knowledge of the
Sabbath was already in their possession.</p>

<p>But how then did God give them the Sabbath?
He did this, first, by delivering them from the
abject bondage of Egypt, where they were a nation
of slaves. And second, by providing them
food in such a manner as to impose the strongest
obligation to keep the Sabbath. Forty years did
he give them bread from heaven, sending it for
six days, and withholding it on the seventh, and
preserving food for them over the Sabbath. Thus
was the Sabbath especially intrusted to them.</p>

<p>As a gift to the Hebrews, the Creator’s great
memorial became a sign between God and themselves.
“I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign
between me and them, that they might know
that I am the Lord that sanctify them.” As a
sign, its object is stated to be, to make known the
true God; and we are told why it was such a sign.
“It is a sign between me and the children of Israel
forever; for in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, and on the seventh day he rested,
and was refreshed.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The institution itself signified
that God created the heavens and the earth
in six days and rested on the seventh. Its observance
by the people signified that the Creator
was their God. How full of meaning was this sign!</p>

<p>The Sabbath was a sign between God and the
children of Israel, because they alone were the
worshipers of the Creator. All other nations had
turned from him to “the gods that have not
made the heavens and the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> For this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
reason the memorial of the great Creator was
committed to the Hebrews, and it became a sign
between the Most High and themselves. Thus
was the Sabbath a golden link uniting the Creator
and his worshipers.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT.</span></h3>

<p>The Holy One upon Mount Sinai—Three great gifts bestowed
upon the Hebrews—The Sabbath proclaimed by the voice
of God—Position assigned it in the moral law—Origin of
the Sabbath—Definite character of the commandment—Revolution
of the earth upon its axis—Name of the Sabbatic
institution—Seventh day of the commandment identical
with the seventh day of the New Testament week—Testimony
of Nehemiah—Moral obligation of the fourth commandment.</p>

</div>

<p>And now we approach the record of that sublime
event, the personal descent of the Lord upon
Mount Sinai.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The sixteenth chapter of Exodus,
as we have seen, is remarkable for the fact that
God gave to Israel the Sabbath; the nineteenth
chapter, for the fact that God gave himself to that
people in solemnly espousing them as a holy nation
unto himself; while the twentieth chapter
will be found remarkable for the act of the Most
High in giving to Israel his law.</p>

<p>It is customary to speak against the Sabbath
and the law as Jewish, because thus given to Israel.
As well might the Creator be spoken
against, who brought them out of Egypt to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
<i>their</i> God, and who styles himself the God of Israel.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
The Hebrews were honored by being thus
intrusted with the Sabbath and the law, not the
Sabbath and the law and the Creator rendered
Jewish by this connection. The sacred writers
speak of the high exaltation of Israel in being
thus intrusted with the law of God.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his
judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any
nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known
them. Praise ye the Lord!” “What advantage then
hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were
committed the oracles of God.” “Who are Israelites;
to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the
covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of
God, and the promises; whose are the fathers, and of
whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all,
God blessed forever. Amen.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After the Most High had solemnly espoused
the people unto himself, as his peculiar treasure
in the earth,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> they were brought forth out of the
camp to meet with God. “And Mount Sinai was
altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended
upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended
as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole
mount quaked greatly.” Out of the midst of this
fire did God proclaim the ten words of his law.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
The fourth of these precepts is the grand law of
the Sabbath. Thus spake the great Law-giver:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six
days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh
day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter,
thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle,
nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six
days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”</p>

</div>

<p>The estimate which the Law-giver placed upon
his Sabbath is seen in that he deemed it worthy
of a place in his code of ten commandments, thus
causing it to stand in the midst of nine immutable
moral precepts. Nor is this to be thought a
small honor that the Most High, naming one by
one the great principles of morality until all are
given, and he adds no more,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> should include in
their number the observance of his hallowed rest-day.
This precept is expressly given to enforce
the observance of the Creator’s great memorial;
and unlike all the others, this one traces its obligation
back to the creation, where that memorial
was ordained.</p>

<p>The Sabbath is to be remembered and kept
holy because that God hallowed it, <i>i.e.</i>, appointed
it to a holy use, at the close of the first week.
And this sanctification or hallowing of the rest-day,
when the first seventh day of time was past,
was the solemn act of setting apart the seventh
day for time to come in memory of the Creator’s
rest. Thus the fourth commandment reaches
back and embraces the institution of the Sabbath
in paradise, while the sanctification of the Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
in paradise extends forward to all coming
time. The narrative respecting the wilderness of
Sin admirably cements the union of the two.
Thus in the wilderness of Sin, before the fourth
commandment was given, stands the Sabbath,
holy to the Lord, with an existing obligation to
observe it, though no commandment in that narrative
creates the obligation. This obligation is
derived from the same source as the fourth commandment,
namely, the sanctification of the Sabbath
in paradise, showing that it was an existing
duty, and not a new precept. For it should never
be forgotten that the fourth commandment does
not trace its obligation to the wilderness of Sin,
but to the creation; a decisive proof that the
Sabbath did not originate in the wilderness of Sin.</p>

<p>The fourth commandment is remarkably definite.
It embraces, first, a precept: “Remember
the Sabbath day, to keep it holy;” second, an explanation
of this precept: “Six days shalt thou
labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day
is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant,
nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within
thy gates;” third, the reasons on which the precept
is based, embracing the origin of the institution,
and the very acts by which it was made,
and enforcing all by the example<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> of the Law-giver
himself: “for in six days the Lord made
heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>The rest-day of the Lord is thus distinguished
from the six days on which he labored. The
blessing and sanctification pertain to the day of
the Creator’s rest. There can be, therefore, no
indefiniteness in the precept. It is not merely
one day in seven, but that day in the seven on
which the Creator rested, and upon which he
placed his blessing, namely, the seventh day.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
And this day is definitely pointed out in the
name given it by God: “The seventh day is the
Sabbath [<i>i. e.</i>, the rest-day] of the Lord thy God.”</p>

<p>That the seventh day in the fourth commandment
is the seventh day of the New-Testament
week may be plainly proved. In the record of
our Lord’s burial, Luke writes thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath
drew on. And the women also which came with him
from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher,
and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared
spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day
according to the commandment. Now upon the first day
of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto
the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared,
and certain others with them.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Luke testifies that these women kept “the
Sabbath day according to the commandment.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
The commandment says, “The seventh day is the
Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” This day thus
observed was the last or seventh day of the week,
for the following<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> day was the first day of the
week. Hence the seventh day of the commandment
is the seventh day of the New-Testament
week.</p>

<p>The testimony of Nehemiah is deeply interesting.
“Thou camest down also upon Mount Sinai,
and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest
them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes
and commandments: and madest known
unto them thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst
them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of
Moses thy servant.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> It is remarkable that God
is said to have made known the Sabbath when
he thus came down upon the mount; for the children
of Israel had the Sabbath in possession when
they came to Sinai. This language must therefore
refer to that complete unfolding of the Sabbatic
institution which is given in the fourth commandment.
And mark the expression: “Madest
known<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> unto them thy holy Sabbath;” not
madest the Sabbath for them: language which
plainly implies its previous existence, and which
cites the mind back to the Creator’s rest for the
origin of the institution.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>The moral obligation of the fourth commandment
which is so often denied may be clearly
shown by reference to the origin of all things.
God created the world and gave existence to
man upon it. To him he gave life and breath,
and all things. Man therefore owes everything
to God. Every faculty of his mind, every power
of his being, all his strength and all his time
belong of right to the Creator. It was therefore
the benevolence of the Creator that gave to man
six days for his own wants. And in setting apart
the seventh day to a holy use in memory of his
own rest, the Most High was reserving unto himself
one of the seven days, when he could rightly
claim all as his. The six days therefore are the
gift of God to man, to be rightly employed in
secular affairs, not the seventh day, the gift of
man to God. The fourth commandment, therefore,
does not require man to give something of
his own to God, but it does require that man
should not appropriate to himself that which God
has reserved for his own worship. To observe
this day then is to render to God of the things
that are his; to appropriate it to ourselves is
simply to rob God.</p>

</div>

<p>When the voice of the Holy One had ceased,
“the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near
unto the thick darkness where God was.” A brief
interview follows<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> in which God gives to Moses a
series of precepts, which, as a sample of the statutes
given through him, may be classified thus:
Ceremonial precepts, pointing to the good things
to come; judicial precepts, intended for the civil
government of the nation; and moral precepts,
stating anew in other forms the ten commandments.
In this brief interview the Sabbath is
not forgotten:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh
day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may rest,
and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be
refreshed.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This scripture furnishes incidental proof that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the Sabbath was made for mankind, and for those
creatures that share the labors of man. The
stranger and the foreigner must keep it, and it
was for their refreshment.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> But the same persons
could not partake of the passover until they
were made members of the Hebrew church by
circumcision.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>When Moses had returned unto the people, he
repeated all the words of the Lord. With one
voice all the people exclaim, “All the words which
the Lord hath said will we do.” Then Moses
wrote all the words of the Lord. “And he took
the book of the covenant and read in the audience
of the people: and they said, All that the Lord
hath said will we do, and be obedient.” Then
Moses “sprinkled both the book and all the people,
saying, This is the blood of the testament
which God hath enjoined unto you.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The way was thus prepared for God to bestow
a second signal honor upon his law:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me into
the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of
stone, and a law, and commandments which I have
written; that thou mayest teach them.... And
Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the
mount. And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount
Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh
day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring
fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of
Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud,
and gat him up into the mount; and Moses was in the
mount forty days and forty nights.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

</div>

<p>During this forty days God gave to Moses a
pattern of the ark in which to place the law that
he had written upon stone, and of the mercy-seat
to place over that law, and of the sanctuary in
which to deposit the ark. He also ordained the
priesthood, which was to minister in the sanctuary
before the ark.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> These things being ordained,
and the Law-giver about to commit his law as
written by himself into the hands of Moses, he
again enjoins the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, Speak thou
also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths
ye shall keep; for it is a sign between me and you
throughout your generations; that ye may know that I
am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep the
Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one
that defileth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever
doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
from among his people. Six days may work be done;
but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the
Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he
shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the children of
Israel shall keep the Sabbath to observe the Sabbath
throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever:
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the
seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto
Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
upon Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written
with the finger of God.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This should be compared with the testimony of
Ezekiel, speaking in the name of God:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments,
which if a man do, he shall even live in them. Moreover
also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between
me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord
that sanctify them.... I am the Lord your God:
walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
them; and hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a
sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am
the Lord your God.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed that neither of these scriptures
teach that the Sabbath was made <i>for</i> Israel,
nor yet do they teach that it was made <i>after</i> the
Hebrews came out of Egypt. In neither of these
particulars do they even <i>seem</i> to contradict those
texts that place the institution of the Sabbath at
creation. But we do learn, 1. That it was God’s
act of giving to the Hebrews his Sabbath that
made it a sign between <i>them</i> and himself. “I
gave them my Sabbaths <span class="smcap">to be</span> a sign between
me and them.” This act of committing to them
the Sabbath has been noticed already.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> 2. That
it was to be a sign between God and the Hebrews,
“that they might know that I am the Lord that
sanctify them.” Wherever the word <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in the
Old Testament is in small capitals, as in the texts
under consideration, it is in the Hebrew, Jehovah.
The Sabbath then as a sign signified that it was
Jehovah, <i>i. e.</i>, the infinite, self-existent God, who
had sanctified them. To sanctify is to separate,
set apart, or appoint, to a holy, sacred or religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
use.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> That the Hebrew nation had thus been set
apart in the most remarkable manner from all
mankind, was sufficiently evident. But who was
it that had thus separated them from all other
people? As a gracious answer to this important
question, God gave to the Hebrews his own hallowed
rest-day. But how could the great memorial
of the Creator determine such a question?
Listen to the words of the Most High: “Verily
my Sabbaths,” <i>i. e.</i>, my rest-days, “ye shall keep;
for it is a sign between me and you.... It is a
sign between me and the children of Israel forever;
for in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was
refreshed.” The Sabbath as a sign between God
and Israel, was a perpetual testimony that he
who had separated them from all mankind as his
peculiar treasure in the earth, was that Being
who had created the heavens and the earth in
six days and rested on the seventh. It was therefore
the strongest possible assurance that he who
sanctified them was indeed Jehovah.</p>

<p>From the days of Abraham God had set apart
the Hebrews. He who had previously borne no
local, national or family name, did from that time
until the end of his covenant relation with the
Hebrew race, take to himself such titles as seemed
to show him to be their God alone. From his
choice of Abraham and his family forward he designates
himself as the God of Abraham, of Isaac,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and of Jacob; the God of the Hebrews, and the
God of Israel.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> He brought Israel out of Egypt
to be <i>their God</i>,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and at Sinai did join himself to
them in solemn espousal. He did thus set apart
or sanctify unto himself the Hebrews, because
that all other nations had given themselves to
idolatry. Thus the God of Heaven and earth
condescended to give himself to a single race, and
to set them apart from all mankind. It should
be observed that it was not the Sabbath which
had set Israel apart from all other nations, but
it was the idolatry of all other nations that
caused God to set the Hebrews apart for himself;
and that God gave to Israel the Sabbath which
he had hallowed for mankind at creation as the
most expressive sign that he who thus sanctified
them was indeed the living God.</p>

<p>It was the act of God in giving his Sabbath to
the Israelites that rendered it a sign <i>between them
and himself</i>. But the Sabbath did not derive its
existence from being thus given to the Hebrews;
for it was the ancient Sabbath of the Lord when
given to them, and we have seen<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> that it was not
given by a new commandment. On the contrary,
it rested at that time upon existing obligation.
But it was the providence of God in behalf of the
Hebrews, first in rescuing them from abject servitude,
and second, in sending them bread from
heaven for six days, and preserving food for the
Sabbath, that constituted the Sabbath a gift to
that people. And mark the significancy of the
<i>manner</i> in which this gift was bestowed, as showing
who it was that sanctified them. It became
a gift to the Hebrews by the wonderful providence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
of the manna: a miracle that ceased not
openly to declare the Sabbath every week for the
space of forty years; thus showing incontrovertibly
that He who led them was the author of the
Sabbath, and therefore the Creator of heaven and
earth. That the Sabbath which was made for
man should thus be given to the Hebrews is certainly
not more remarkable than that the God of
the whole earth should give his oracles and himself
to that people. The Most High and his law
and Sabbath did not become Jewish; but the
Hebrews were made the honored depositaries of
divine truth; and the knowledge of God and of
his commandments was preserved in the earth.</p>

<p>The reason on which this sign is based, points
unmistakably to the true origin of the Sabbath.
It did not originate from the fall of the manna for
six days and its cessation on the seventh—for the
manna was given thus because the Sabbath was
in existence—but because that “in six days the
Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh
day he rested and was refreshed.” Thus the
Sabbath is shown to have originated with the
rest and refreshment of the Creator, and not at
the fall of the manna. As an <span class="smcap">institution</span>, the
Sabbath declared its Author to be the Creator of
heaven and earth; as a <i>sign<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> between God and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Israel</i>, it declared that he who had set them apart
was indeed Jehovah.</p>

<p>The last act of the Law-giver in this memorable
interview was to place in the hands of Moses the
“two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written
with the finger of God.” Then he revealed to
Moses the sad apostasy of the people of Israel,
and hastened him down to them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And Moses turned, and went down from the mount,
and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand:
the tables were written on both their sides: on the one
side and on the other were they written. And the tables
were the work of God, and the writing was the writing
of God, graven upon the tables.... And it came to
pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw
the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot,
and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them
beneath the mount.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then Moses inflicted retribution upon the idolaters,
“and there fell of the people that day about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
three thousand men.” And Moses returned unto
God and interceded in behalf of the people. Then
God promised that his angel should go with them,
but that he himself would not go up in their
midst lest he should consume them.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Then Moses
presented an earnest supplication to the Most
High that he might see his glory. This petition
was granted, saving that the face of God should
not be seen.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>But before Moses ascended that he might behold
the majesty of the infinite Law-giver, the
Lord said unto him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and
I will write upon these tables the words that were in the
first tables, which thou brakest.... And he hewed two
tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up
early in the morning, and went up unto Mount Sinai, as
the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the
two tables of stone. And the Lord descended in the
cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the
name of the Lord. And the Lord passed by before him.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then Moses beheld the glory of the Lord, and
he “made haste and bowed his head toward the
earth and worshiped.” This interview lasted
forty days and forty nights, as did the first, and
seems to have been spent by Moses in intercession
that God would not destroy the people for their
sin.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The record of this period is very brief, but
in this record the Sabbath is mentioned. “Six
days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day
thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest
thou shalt rest.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Thus admonishing them not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
forget in their busiest season the Sabbath of the
Lord.</p>

<p>This second period of forty days ends like the
first with the act of God in placing the tables of
stone in the hands of Moses. “And he was there
with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he
did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant,
the ten commandments.” Thus it appears that
the tables of testimony were two tables of stone
with the ten commandments written upon them
by the finger of God. Thus the testimony of
God is shown to be the ten commandments. The
writing on the second tables was an exact copy
of that on the first. “Hew thee two tables of
stone like unto the first; and I will write,” said
God, “upon these tables the words that were in
the first tables, which thou brakest.” And of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the first tables Moses says: “He declared unto
you his covenant, which he commanded you to
perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote
them upon two tables of stone.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Thus did God commit to his people the ten
commandments. Without human or angelic
agency he proclaimed them himself; and not
trusting his most honored servant Moses, or even
an angel of his presence, himself wrote them with
his own finger. “Remember the Sabbath day, to
keep it holy,” is one of the ten words thus honored
by the Most High. Nor are these two high
honors the only ones conferred upon this precept.
While it shares them in common with the other
nine commandments, it stands in advance of them
in that it is established by the <span class="smcap">example</span> of the
Law-giver himself. These precepts were given
upon two tables with evident reference to the
two-fold division of the law of God; supreme
love to God, and the love of our neighbor as ourselves.
The Sabbath commandment, placed at
the close of the first table, forms the golden clasp
that binds together both divisions of the moral
law. It guards and enforces that day which God
claims as his; it follows man through the six
days which God has given him to be properly
spent in the various relations of life, thus extending
over the whole of human life, and embracing
in its loan of six days to man all the duties of
the second table, while itself belonging to the first.</p>

<p>That these ten commandments form a complete
code of moral law is proved by the language of
the Law-giver when he called Moses up to himself
to receive them. “Come up to me into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables
of stone, and a law, and commandments which I
have written.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> This law and commandments
was the testimony of God engraven upon stone.
The same great fact is presented by Moses in his
blessing pronounced upon Israel: “And he said,
The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
unto them: he shined forth from Mount Paran,
and he came with ten thousands of saints: <i>from
his right hand</i> went a fiery law for them.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> There
can be no dispute that in this language the Most
High is represented as personally present with
ten thousands of his holy ones, or angels. And
that which he wrote with his own right hand is
called by Moses “a fiery law,” or as the margin
has it, “a fire of law.” And now the man of God
completes his sacred trust. And thus he rehearses
what God did in committing his law to him, and
what he himself did in its final disposition: “And
he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
the ten commandments, which the Lord
spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of
the fire in the day of the assembly: and the
Lord gave them unto me. And I turned myself
and came down from the mount, and put the tables
in the ark which I had made; and there
they be, as the Lord commanded me.” Thus was
the law of God deposited in the ark beneath the
mercy-seat.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Nor should this chapter close without
pointing out the important relation of the
fourth commandment to the atonement.</p>

<p>The top of the ark was called the mercy-seat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
because all those who had broken the law contained
in the ark beneath the mercy-seat, could
find pardon by the sprinkling of the blood of
atonement upon it.</p>

<p>The law within the ark was that which demanded
an atonement; the ceremonial law which
ordained the Levitical priesthood and the sacrifices
for sin, was that which taught men how the
atonement could be made. The broken law was
beneath the mercy-seat; the blood of sin-offering
was sprinkled upon its top, and pardon was extended
to the penitent sinner. There was actual
sin, and hence a real law which man had broken;
but there was not a real atonement, and hence
the need of the great antitype to the Levitical
sacrifices. The real atonement when it is made
must relate to that law respecting which an
atonement had been shadowed forth. In other
words, the shadowy atonement related to that
law which was shut up in the ark, indicating
that a real atonement was demanded by that
law. It is necessary that the law which demands
atonement, in order that its transgressor
may be spared, should itself be perfect, else the
fault would in part at least rest with the Law-giver,
and not wholly with the sinner. Hence,
the atonement when made does not take away
the broken law, for that is perfect, but is expressly
designed to take away the guilt of the transgressor.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Let it be remembered then that the
fourth commandment is one of the ten precepts
of God’s broken law; one of the immutable holy
principles that made the death of God’s only Son
necessary before pardon could be extended to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
guilty man. These facts being borne in mind, it
will not be thought strange that the Law-giver
should reserve the proclamation of such a law to
himself; and that he should intrust to no created
being the writing of that law which should
demand as its atonement the death of the Son
of God.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SABBATH DURING THE DAY OF TEMPTATION.</span></h3>

<p>General history of the Sabbath in the wilderness—Its violation
one cause of excluding that generation from the promised
land—Its violation by their children in the wilderness
one of the causes of their final dispersion from their own
land—The statute respecting fires upon the Sabbath—Various

appeal of Moses in behalf of the Sabbath—The original
fourth commandment—The Sabbath not a memorial of the

summary from the books of Moses.</p>

</div>

<p>The history of the Sabbath during the provocation
in the day of temptation in the wilderness
when God was grieved for forty years with his
people may be stated in few words. Even under
the eye of Moses, and with the most stupendous
miracles in their memory and before their eyes,
they were idolaters,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> neglecters of sacrifices, neglecters
of circumcision,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> murmurers against God,
despisers of his law<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and violators of his Sabbath.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Of their treatment of the Sabbath while
in the wilderness, Ezekiel gives us the following
graphic description:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the
wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they
despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even
live in them; and my Sabbaths they greatly polluted:
then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the
wilderness, to consume them. But I wrought for my
name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the
heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This language shows a general violation of the
Sabbath, and evidently refers to the apostasy of
Israel during the first forty days that Moses was
absent from them. God did then purpose their
destruction; but at the intercession of Moses,
spared them for the very reason assigned by the
prophet.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> A further probation being granted them
they signally failed a second time, so that God
lifted up his hand to them that they should not
enter the promised land. Thus the prophet continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness,
that I would not bring them into the land which I
had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is
the glory of all lands; <span class="smcap">because</span> they despised my judgments,
and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my
Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. Nevertheless
mine eye spared them from destroying them,
neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.”</p>

</div>

<p>This language has undoubted reference to the
act of God in excluding all that were over twenty
years of age from entering the promised land.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
It is to be noticed that the violation of the Sabbath
is distinctly stated as one of the reasons for
which that generation were excluded from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
land of promise. God spared the people so that
the nation was not utterly cut off; for he extended
to the younger part a further probation.
Thus the prophet continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But I said unto their children in the wilderness,
Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe
their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their
idols: I am the Lord your God; walk in my statutes, and
keep my judgments, and do them; and hallow my Sabbaths;
and they shall be a sign between me and you,
that ye may know that I am the Lord your God. Notwithstanding
the children rebelled against me: they
walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to
do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them;
they polluted my Sabbaths: then I said, I would pour
out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against
them in the wilderness. Nevertheless I withdrew mine
hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should
not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose
sight I brought them forth. I lifted up mine hand unto
them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them
among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
because they had not executed my judgments, but
had despised my statutes, and had polluted my Sabbaths,
and their eyes were after their father’s idols.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus it appears that the younger generation,
which God spared when he excluded their fathers
from the land of promise, did, like their fathers,
transgress God’s law, pollute his Sabbath, and
cleave to idolatry. God did not see fit to exclude
them from the land of Canaan, but he did lift up
his hand to them in the wilderness, that he would
give them up to dispersion among their enemies
after they had entered the land of promise. Thus
it is seen that the Hebrews while in the wilderness
laid the foundation for their subsequent dispersion
from their own land; and that one of the
acts which led to their final ruin as a nation was
the violation of the Sabbath before they had entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
the promised land. Well might Moses say
to them in the last month of his life: “Ye have
been rebellious against the Lord from the day
that I knew you.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In Caleb and Joshua was
another spirit, for they followed the Lord fully.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Such is the general history of Sabbatic observance
in the wilderness. Even the miracle of the
manna, which every week for forty years bore
public testimony to the Sabbath,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> became to the
body of the Hebrews a mere ordinary event, so
that they dared to murmur against the bread thus
sent from heaven;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and we may well believe that
those who were thus hardened through the deceitfulness
of sin, had little regard for the testimony
of the manna in behalf of the Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
In the Mosaic record we next read of the Sabbath
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children
of Israel together, and said unto them, These are
the words which the Lord hath commanded, that ye
should do them. Six days shall work be done, but on
the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a Sabbath
of rest to the Lord: whosoever doeth work therein
shall be put to death.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Ye shall kindle no fire throughout
your habitations upon the Sabbath day.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The chief feature of interest in this text relates
to the prohibition of fires on the Sabbath. As
this is the only prohibition of the kind in the Bible,
and as it is often urged as a reason why the
Sabbath should not be kept, a brief examination
of the difficulty will not be out of place. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
should be observed, 1. That this language does
not form part of the fourth commandment, the
grand law of the Sabbath. 2. That as there
were laws pertaining to the Sabbath, that were
no part of the Sabbatic institution, but that grew
out of its being intrusted to the Hebrews, such
as the law respecting the presentation of the
shew-bread on the Sabbath; and that respecting
the burnt-offering for the Sabbath:<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> so it is at
least possible that this is a precept pertaining
only to that nation, and not a part of the original
institution. 3. That as there were laws peculiar
only to the Hebrews, so there were many
that pertained to them only while they were in
the wilderness. Such were all those precepts that
related to the manna, the building of the tabernacle
and the setting of it up, the manner of encamping
about it, &amp;c. 4. That of this class were
all the statutes given from the time that Moses
brought down the second tables of stone until
the close of the book of Exodus, unless the words
under consideration form an exception. 5. That
the prohibition of fires was a law of this class,
<i>i. e.</i>, a law designed only for the wilderness, is
evident from several decisive facts.</p>

<p>1. That the land of Palestine during a part of
the year is so cold that fires are necessary to prevent
suffering.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>2. That the Sabbath was not designed to be a
cause of distress and suffering, but of refreshment,
of delight, and of blessing.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>3. That in the wilderness of Sinai, where this
precept respecting fires on the Sabbath was given,
it was not a cause of suffering, as they were two
hundred miles south of Jerusalem, in the warm
climate of Arabia.</p>

<p>4. That this precept was of a temporary character,
is further implied in that while other laws
are said to be perpetual statutes and precepts to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
be kept after they should enter the land,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> no hint
of this kind here appears. On the contrary, this
seems to be similar in character to the precept respecting
the manna,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and to be co-existent with,
and adapted to, it.</p>

<p>5. If the prohibition respecting fires did indeed
pertain to the promised land, and not merely to
the wilderness, it would every few years conflict
directly with the law of the passover. For the
passover was to be roasted by each family of the
children of Israel on the evening following the
fourteenth day of the first month,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> which would
fall occasionally upon the Sabbath. The prohibition
of fires upon the Sabbath would not conflict
with the passover while the Hebrews were in the
wilderness; for the passover was not to be observed
until they reached that land.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> But if that
prohibition did extend forward to the promised
land, where the passover was to be regularly observed,
these two statutes would often come in
direct conflict. This is certainly a strong confirmation
of the view that the prohibition of fires
upon the Sabbath was a temporary statute, relating
only to the wilderness.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>From these facts it follows that the favorite
argument drawn from the prohibition of fires,
that the Sabbath was a local institution, adapted
only to the land of Canaan, must be abandoned;
for it is evident that that prohibition was a temporary
statute not even adapted to the land of
promise, and not designed for that land. We
next read of the Sabbath as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto
all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto
them, Ye shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy.
Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and
keep my Sabbaths: I am the Lord your God.... Ye
shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I
am the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These constant references to the Sabbath contrast
strikingly with the general disobedience of
the people. And thus God speaks again:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Six days shall work be done; but the seventh day is
the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no
work therein: it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your
dwellings.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>Thus does God solemnly designate his rest-day
as a season of holy worship, and as the day of
weekly religious assemblies. Again the great
Law-giver sets forth his Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither
rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any
image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it; for I
am the Lord your God. Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and
reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Happy would it have been for the people of
God had they thus refrained from idolatry and
sacredly regarded the rest-day of the Creator.
Yet idolatry and Sabbath-breaking were so general
in the wilderness that the generation which
came forth from Egypt were excluded from the
promised land.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> After God had thus cut off from
the inheritance of the land the men who had rebelled
against him,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> we next read of the Sabbath
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness,
they found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath
day. And they that found him gathering sticks
brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
And they put him in ward, because it was not
declared what should be done to him. And the Lord said
unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death; all
the congregation shall stone him with stones without the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
camp. And all the congregation brought him without the
camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the
Lord commanded Moses.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The following facts should be considered in explaining
this text: 1. That this was a case of peculiar
guilt; for the whole congregation before
whom this man stood in judgment, and by whom
he was put to death, were themselves guilty of
violating the Sabbath, and had just been excluded
from the promised land for this and other sins.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
2. That this was not a case which came under
the existing penalty of death for work upon the
Sabbath; for the man was put in confinement
that the mind of the Lord respecting his guilt
might be obtained. The peculiarity of his transgression
may be learned from the context. The
verses which next precede the case in question
read thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously, whether
he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth
the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from
among his people. Because he hath despised the word of
the Lord, and hath broken his commandment, that soul
shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These words being followed by this remarkable
case were evidently designed to be illustrated by
it. It is manifest, therefore, that this was an instance
of presumptuous sin, in which the transgressor
intended despite to the Spirit of grace
and to the statutes of the Most High. This case
cannot therefore be quoted as evidence of extraordinary
strictness on the part of the Hebrews in
observing the Sabbath; for we have direct evidence
that they did greatly pollute it during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
whole forty years of their sojourn in the wilderness.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
It stands therefore as an instance of transgression
in which the sinner intended to show his
contempt for the Law-giver, and in this consisted
his peculiar guilt.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>In the last month of his long and eventful life
Moses rehearsed all the great acts of God in behalf
of his people, with the statutes and precepts
that he had given them. This rehearsal is contained
in the book of Deuteronomy, a name which
signifies second law, and which is applied to that
book, because it is a second writing of the law.
It is the farewell of Moses to a disobedient and
rebellious people; and he endeavors to fasten
upon them the strongest possible sense of personal
obligation to obey. Thus, when he is about to
rehearse the ten commandments, he uses language
evidently designed to impress upon the minds of
the Hebrews a sense of their individual obligation
to do what God had commanded. Thus he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I
speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
keep, and do them. The Lord our God made a covenant
with us in Horeb. The Lord made not this covenant with
our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here
alive this day.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was not the act of your fathers that placed
this responsibility upon you, but your own individual
acts that brought you into the bond of this
covenant. You have personally pledged yourselves
to the Most High to keep these precepts.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
Such is the obvious import of this language;
yet it has been gravely adduced as proof that the
Sabbath of the Lord was made for the Hebrews,
and was not obligatory upon the patriarchs. The
singularity of this deduction appears in that it is
brought to bear against the fourth commandment
alone; whereas, if it is a just and logical argument,
it would show that the ancient patriarchs
were under no obligation in respect to any precept
of the moral law. But it is certain that the covenant
at Horeb was simply an embodiment of
the precepts of the moral law, with mutual pledges
respecting them between God and the people,
and that that covenant did not give existence to
either of the ten commandments. At all events,
we find the Sabbath ordained of God at the close
of creation<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and obligatory upon the Hebrews in
the wilderness before God had given them a new
precept on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> As this was before the
covenant at Horeb it is conclusive proof that the
Sabbath did no more originate from that covenant
than did the prohibition of idolatry, theft or
murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>The man of God then repeats the ten commandments.
And thus he gives the fourth:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Keep the Sabbath day, to sanctify it, as the Lord thy
God hath commanded thee. Six days thou shalt labor
and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work,
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant,
nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any
of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;
that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as
well as thou. And remember that thou wast a servant
in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought
thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched-out
arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to
keep the Sabbath day.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is a singular fact that this scripture is uniformly
quoted by those who write against the
Sabbath, as the original fourth commandment;
while the original precept itself is carefully left
out. Yet there is the strongest evidence that
this is not the original precept; for Moses rehearses
these words at the end of the forty years’
sojourn, whereas the original commandment was
given in the third month after the departure from
Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The commandment itself, as here given,
contains direct proof on the point. Thus it reads:
“Keep the Sabbath day, to sanctify it, As the
Lord thy God <span class="smcap">hath commanded</span> thee;” thus
citing elsewhere for the original statute. Moreover
the precept as here given is evidently incomplete.
It contains no clue to the origin of
the Sabbath of the Lord, nor does it show the
acts by which the Sabbath came into existence.
This is why those who represent the Sabbath as
made in the wilderness and not at creation quote
this as the fourth commandment, and omit the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
original precept, which God himself proclaimed,
where all these facts are distinctly stated.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>But while Moses in this rehearsal omits a large
part of the fourth commandment, he refers to the
original precept for the whole matter, and then
appends to this rehearsal a powerful plea of obligation
on the part of the Hebrews to keep the
Sabbath. It should be remembered that many
of the people had steadily persisted in the violation
of the Sabbath, and that this is the last time
that Moses speaks in its behalf. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And remember that thou wast a servant in the land
of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out
thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched-out
arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to
keep the Sabbath day.”</p>

</div>

<p>These words are often cited as proof that the
Sabbath originated at the departure of Israel from
Egypt, and that it was ordained at that time as
a memorial of their deliverance from thence.
But it will be observed, 1. That this text says
not one word respecting the origin of the Sabbath
or rest-day of the Lord. 2. That the facts
on this point are all given in the original fourth
commandment, and are there referred to creation.
3. That there is no reason to believe that
God rested upon the seventh day at the time of
this flight from Egypt; nor did he then bless and
hallow the day. 4. That the Sabbath has nothing
in it of a kind to commemorate the deliverance
from Egypt, as that was a flight and this is
a rest; and that flight was upon the fifteenth of
the first month, and this rest, upon the seventh
day of each week. Thus one would occur annually;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the other, weekly. 5. But God did ordain
a fitting memorial of that deliverance to be observed
by the Hebrews: the passover, on the
fourteenth day of the first month, in memory of
God’s passing over them when he smote the
Egyptians; and the feast of unleavened bread,
in memory of their eating this bread when they
fled out of Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>But what then do these words imply? Perhaps
their meaning may be more readily perceived by
comparing them with an exact parallel found in
the same book and from the pen of the same
writer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger,
nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow’s raiment to
pledge; but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman
in Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee
thence; therefore I command thee to do this thing.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that this precept
was not given to commemorate the deliverance
of Israel from Egyptian bondage; nor could that
deliverance give existence to the moral obligation
expressed in it. If the language in the one case
proves that men were not under obligation to
keep the Sabbath before the deliverance of Israel
from Egypt, it proves with equal conclusiveness
in the other that before that deliverance they
were not under obligation to treat with justice
and mercy the stranger, the fatherless, and the
widow. And if the Sabbath is shown in the one
case to be Jewish, in the other, the statute of the
great Law-giver in behalf of the needy and the
helpless must share the same fate. It is manifest
that this language is in each case an appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
their sense of gratitude. You were slaves in
Egypt, and God rescued you; therefore remember
others who are in distress, and oppress them not.
You were bondmen in Egypt, and God redeemed
you; therefore sanctify unto the Lord the day
which he has reserved unto himself; a most
powerful appeal to those who had hitherto persisted
in polluting it. Deliverance from abject
servitude was necessary, indeed, in each case, in
order that the things enjoined might be fully observed;
but that deliverance did not give existence
to either of these duties. It was indeed one
of the acts by which the Sabbath of the Lord
was given to that nation, but it was not one of
the acts by which God made the Sabbath, nor
did it render the rest-day of the Lord a Jewish
institution.</p>

<p>That the words engraven upon stone were simply
the ten commandments is evident.</p>

<p>1. It is said of the first tables:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the
fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude;
only ye heard a voice. And he declared unto you
his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even
ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables
of stone.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

</div>

<p>2. Thus the first tables of stone contained the
ten commandments alone. That the second tables
were an exact copy of what was written upon the
first, is plainly stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the Lord said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables
of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these
tables the words that were in the first tables, which
thou breakest.” “And I will write on the tables the
words that were in the first tables which thou breakest,
and thou shalt put them in the ark.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>3. This is confirmed by the following decisive
testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant,
the ten commandments,” margin, Heb., “words.”
“And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
the ten commandments [margin, words], which the
Lord spake unto you in the mount, out of the midst of
the fire in the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave
them unto me.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These texts will explain the following language:
“And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of
stone written with the finger of God; and on
them was written according to all the words
which the Lord spake with you in the mount out
of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
Thus God is said to have written upon
the tables according to all the words which he
spoke in the day of the assembly; and these
words which he thus wrote, are said to have been
<span class="smcap">ten words</span>. But the preface to the decalogue
was not one of these ten words, and hence was
not written by the finger of God upon stone.
That this distinction must be attended to, will be
seen by examining the following text and its
connection:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">These words</span> the Lord spake unto all your assembly
in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud,
and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he
added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of
stone, and delivered them unto me.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">These words</span> here brought to view as written
by the finger of God after having been uttered
by him in the hearing of all the people, must be
understood as one of two things. 1. They are
simply the ten words of the law of God; or, 2.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
They are all the words used by Moses in this rehearsal
of the decalogue. But they cannot refer
to the words used in this rehearsal; for, 1. Moses
omits an important part of the fourth precept as
given by God in its proclamation from the mount.
2. In this rehearsal of that precept he cites back
to the original for that which is omitted.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> 3. He
appends to this precept an appeal in its behalf
to their gratitude which was not made by God
in giving it. 4. This language only purports to
be a rehearsal and not the original itself; and
this is further evinced by many verbal deviations
from the original decalogue.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> These facts are decisive
as to what was placed upon the tables of
stone. It was not an incomplete copy, citing elsewhere
for the original, but the original code itself.
And hence when Moses speaks of <span class="smcap">these
words</span> as engraven upon the tables, he refers not
to the words used by himself in this rehearsal,
but to the <span class="smcap">ten words</span> of the law of God, and excludes
all else.</p>

<p>Thus have we traced the Sabbath through the
books of Moses. We have found its origin in
paradise when man was in his uprightness; we
have seen the Hebrews set apart from all mankind
as the depositaries of divine truth; we have
seen the Sabbath and the whole moral law committed
as a sacred trust to them; we have seen
the Sabbath proclaimed by God as one of the
ten commandments; we have seen it written by
the finger of God upon stone in the bosom of the
moral law; we have seen that law possessing no
Jewish, but simply moral and divine, features,
placed beneath the mercy-seat in the ark of God’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
testament; we have seen that various precepts
pertaining to the Sabbath were given to the Hebrews
and designed only for them; we have seen
that the Hebrews did greatly pollute the Sabbath
during their sojourn in the wilderness; and
we have heard the final appeal made in its behalf
by Moses to that rebellious people.</p>

<p>We rest the foundation of the Sabbatic institution
upon its sanctification before the fall of man;
the fourth commandment is its great citadel of
defense; its place in the midst of the moral law
beneath the mercy-seat shows its relation to the
atonement and its immutable obligation.</p>

land—The jubilee—None of these festivals in force until

</div>

<p>We have followed the Sabbath of the Lord
through the books of Moses. A brief survey of
the Jewish festivals is necessary to the complete
view of the subject before us. Of these there
were three feasts: the passover, the Pentecost,
and the feast of tabernacles; each new moon,
that is, the first day of each month throughout
the year; then there were seven annual sabbaths,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
namely, 1. The first day of unleavened bread.
2. The seventh day of that feast. 3. The day of
Pentecost. 4. The first day of the seventh month.
5. The tenth day of that month. 6. The fifteenth
day of that month. 7. The twenty-second day
of the same. In addition to all these, every seventh
year was to be the sabbath of the land, and
every fiftieth year the year of jubilee.</p>

<p>The passover takes its name from the fact that
the angel of the Lord passed over the houses of
the Hebrews on that eventful night when the
firstborn in every Egyptian family was slain.
This feast was ordained in commemoration of the
deliverance of that people from Egyptian bondage.
It began with the slaying of the paschal
lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month,
and extended through a period of seven days, in
which nothing but unleavened bread was to be
eaten. Its great antitype was reached when
Christ our passover was sacrificed for us.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The Pentecost was the second of the Jewish
feasts, and occupied but a single day. It was celebrated
on the fiftieth day after the first-fruits of
barley harvest had been waved before the Lord.
At the time of this feast the first-fruits of wheat
harvest were offered unto God. The antitype of
this festival was reached on the fiftieth day after
the resurrection of Christ, when the great outpouring
of the Holy Ghost took place.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The feast of tabernacles was the last of the
Jewish feasts. It was celebrated in the seventh
month when they had gathered in the fruit of
the land, and extended from the fifteenth to the
twenty-first day of that month. It was ordained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
as a festival of rejoicing before the Lord; and
during this period the children of Israel dwelt in
booths in commemoration of their dwelling thus
during their sojourn in the wilderness. It probably
typifies the great rejoicing after the final
gathering of all the people of God into his kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>In connection with these feasts it was ordained
that each new moon, that is, the first day of every
month, should be observed with certain specified
offerings, and with tokens of rejoicing.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The
annual sabbaths of the Hebrews have been already
enumerated. The first two of these sabbaths
were the first and seventh days of the feast
of unleavened bread, that is, the fifteenth and
twenty-first days of the first month. They were
thus ordained by God:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the
first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses....
And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation,
and in the seventh day there shall be an holy
convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in
them, save that which every man must eat, that only
may be done of you.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The third in order of the annual sabbaths was
the day of Pentecost. This festival was ordained
as a rest-day in the following language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it
may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no
servile work therein; it shall be a statute forever in all
your dwellings throughout your generations.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The first day of the seventh month was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
fourth annual sabbath of the Hebrews. It was
thus ordained:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh
month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have
a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy
convocation. Ye shall do no servile work therein; but
ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The great day of atonement was the fifth of
these sabbaths. Thus spake the Lord unto Moses:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there
shall be a day of atonement; it shall be an holy convocation
unto you.... Ye shall do no manner of work; it
shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in
all your dwellings. It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest,
and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the
month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate
your sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The sixth and seventh of these annual sabbaths
were the fifteenth and twenty-second days
of the seventh month, that is, the first day
of the feast of tabernacles, and the day after its
conclusion. Thus were they enjoined by God:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when
ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a
feast unto the Lord seven days; on the first day shall be
a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Besides all these, every seventh year was a
sabbath of rest unto the land. The people might
labor as usual in other business, but they were
forbidden to till the land, that the land itself
might rest.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> After seven of these sabbaths, the
following or fiftieth year was to be the year of
jubilee, in which every man was to be restored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
unto his inheritance.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> There is no evidence that
the jubilee was ever observed, and it is certain
that the sabbatical year was almost entirely disregarded.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Such were the feasts, new moons, and sabbaths,
of the Hebrews. A few words will suffice to
point out the broad distinction between them and
the Sabbath of the Lord. The first of the three
feasts was ordained in memory of their deliverance
from Egyptian bondage, and was to be observed
when they should enter their own land.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
The second feast, as we have seen, could not be
observed until after the settlement of the Hebrews
in Canaan; for it was to be celebrated when the
first fruits of wheat harvest should be offered before
the Lord. The third feast was ordained in
memory of their sojourn in the wilderness, and
was to be celebrated by them each year after the
ingathering of the entire harvest. Of course this
feast, like the others, could not be observed until
the settlement of the people in their own land.
The new moons, as has been already seen, were
not ordained until after these feasts had been instituted.
The annual sabbaths were part and
parcel of these feasts, and could have no existence
until after the feasts to which they belonged had
been instituted. Thus the first and second of
these sabbaths were the first and seventh days of
the paschal feast. The third annual sabbath was
identical with the feast of Pentecost. The fourth
of these sabbaths was the same as the new moon
in the seventh month. The fifth one was the
great day of atonement. The sixth and the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
of these annual sabbaths were the fifteenth
and twenty-second days of the seventh month,
that is, the first day of the feast of tabernacles,
and the next day after the close of that feast.
As these feasts were not to be observed until the
Hebrews should possess their own land, the annual
sabbaths could have no existence until that
time. And so of the sabbaths of the land. These
could have no existence until after the Hebrews
should possess and cultivate their own land;
after six years of cultivation, the land should
rest the seventh year, and remain untilled. After
seven of these sabbaths of the land came the year
of jubilee.</p>

<p>The contrast between the Sabbath of the Lord
and these sabbaths of the Hebrews<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> is strongly
marked. 1. The Sabbath of the Lord was instituted
at the close of the first week of time; while
these were ordained in connection with the Jewish
feasts. 2. The one was blessed and hallowed
by God, because that he had rested upon it from
the work of creation; the others have no such
claim to our regard. 3. When the children of
Israel came into the wilderness, the Sabbath of
the Lord was an existing institution, obligatory
upon them; but the annual sabbaths then came
into existence. It is easy to point to the very
act of God, while leading that people, that gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
existence to these sabbaths; while every reference
to the Sabbath of the Lord shows that it
had been ordained before God chose that people.
4. The children of Israel were excluded
from the promised land for violating the Sabbath
of the Lord in the wilderness; but the
annual sabbaths were not to be observed until
they should enter that land. This contrast would
be strange indeed were it true that the Sabbath
of the Lord was not instituted until the children
of Israel came into the wilderness of Sin; for it
is certain that two of the annual sabbaths were
instituted before they left the land of Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> 5.
The Sabbath of the Lord was made for man; but
the annual sabbaths were designed only for residents
in the land of Palestine. 6. The one was
weekly, a memorial of the Creator’s rest; the
others were annual, connected with the memorials
of the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt.
7. The one is termed “the Sabbath of the Lord,”
“my Sabbaths,” “my holy day,” and the like;
while the others are designated as “your sabbaths,”
“her sabbaths,” and similar expressions.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
8. The one was proclaimed by God as one of the
ten commandments, and was written with his finger
in the midst of the moral law upon the tables
of stone, and was deposited in the ark beneath
the mercy-seat; the others did not pertain to the
moral law, but were embodied in that handwriting
of ordinances that was a shadow of good
things to come. 9. The distinction between these
festivals and the Sabbaths of the Lord was carefully
marked by God when he ordained the festivals
and their associated sabbaths. Thus he said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
“These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall
proclaim to be holy convocations, ... <span class="smcap">beside</span>
the Sabbaths of the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The annual sabbaths are presented by Isaiah
in a very different light from that in which he
presents the Sabbath of the Lord. Of the one
he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination
unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling
of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even
the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed
feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I
am weary to bear them.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In striking contrast with this, the same prophet
speaks of the Lord’s Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do
justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my
righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the man that
doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it;
that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth
his hand from doing any evil. Neither let the son of
the stranger, that hath joined himself to the Lord, speak,
saying, The Lord hath utterly separated me from his people;
neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my
Sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take
hold of my covenant; even unto them will I give in
mine house and within my walls a place and a name better
than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an
everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. Also the
sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord,
to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be his
servants, every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting
it, and taketh hold of my covenant; even them will
I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in
my house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices
shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house
shall be called a house of prayer for all people.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Hosea carefully designates the annual sabbaths
in the following prediction:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast-days,
her new moons, and <span class="smcap">her</span> sabbaths, and all her solemn
feasts.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This prediction was uttered about <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 785. It
was fulfilled in part about two hundred years
after this, when Jerusalem was destroyed by
Nebuchadnezzar. Of this event, Jeremiah, about
<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 588, speaks as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none
did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at
<span class="smcap">her</span> sabbaths.... The Lord was as an enemy; he
hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her
palaces; he hath destroyed his strongholds, and hath increased
in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as
if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his places of the
assembly; the Lord hath caused the solemn feasts and
sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the
indignation of his anger the king and the priest. The
Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary,
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the
walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house
of the Lord, as in the day of a solemn feast.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The feasts of the Lord were to be holden in
the place which the Lord should choose, namely,
Jerusalem;<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and when that city, the place of
their solemn assemblies, was destroyed and the
people themselves carried into captivity, the complete
cessation of their feasts, and, as a consequence,
of the annual sabbaths, which were specified
days in those feasts, must occur. The adversaries
mocked at her sabbaths, by making a
“noise in the house of the Lord as in the day of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
a solemn feast.” But the observance of the
Lord’s Sabbath did not cease with the dispersion
of the Hebrews from their own land; for it was
not a local institution, like the annual sabbaths.
Its violation was one chief cause of the Babylonish
captivity;<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and their final restoration to their
own land was made conditional upon their observing
it in their dispersion.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The feasts, new
moons, and annual sabbaths, were restored when
the Hebrews returned from captivity, and with
some interruptions, were kept up until the final
destruction of their city and nation by the Romans.
But ere the providence of God thus struck
out of existence these Jewish festivals, the whole
typical system was abolished, having reached the
commencement of its antitype, when our Lord
Jesus Christ expired upon the cross. The handwriting
of ordinances being thus abolished, no
one is to be judged respecting its meats, or drinks,
or holy days, or new moons, or sabbaths, “which
are a shadow of things to come; but the body is
of Christ.” But the Sabbath of the Lord did
not form a part of this handwriting of ordinances;
for it was instituted before sin had entered
the world, and consequently before there was
any shadow of redemption; it was written by
the finger of God, not in the midst of types and
shadows, but in the bosom of the moral law; and
the day following that on which the typical sabbaths
were nailed to the cross, the Sabbath commandment
of the moral law is expressly recognized.
Moreover, when the Jewish festivals were utterly
extinguished with the final destruction of Jerusalem,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
even then was the Sabbath of the Lord
brought to the minds of his people.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Thus have
we traced the annual sabbaths until their final
cessation, as predicted by Hosea. It remains
that we trace the Sabbath of the Lord until we
reach the endless ages of the new earth, when
we shall find the whole multitude of the redeemed
assembling before God for worship on
each successive Sabbath.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SABBATH FROM DAVID TO NEHEMIAH.</span></h3>

sun—David’s act of eating the shew-bread—The Sabbath

</div>

<p>When we leave the books of Moses there is a
long-continued break in the history of the Sabbath.
No mention of it is found in the book of
Joshua, nor in that of Judges, nor in the book of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Ruth, nor in that of first Samuel, nor in the book
of second Samuel, nor in that of first Kings. It
is not until we reach the book of second Kings<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
that the Sabbath is even mentioned. In the book
of first Chronicles, however, which as a narrative
is parallel to the two books of Samuel, the Sabbath
is mentioned<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> with reference to the events
of David’s life. Yet this leaves a period of five
hundred years, which the Bible passes in silence
respecting the Sabbath.</p>

<p>During this period we have a circumstantial
history of the Hebrew people from their entrance
into the promised land forward to the establishment
of David as their king, embracing many
particulars in the life of Joshua, of the elders and
judges of Israel, of Gideon, of Barak, of Jephthah,
of Samson, of Eli, of Naomi and Ruth, of Hannah
and Samuel, of Saul, of Jonathan and of David.
Yet in all this minute record we have no direct
mention of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>It is a favorite argument with anti-Sabbatarians
in proof of the total neglect of the Sabbath in
the patriarchal age, that the book of Genesis,
which does give a distinct view of the origin of
the Sabbath in Paradise, at the close of the first
week of time, does not in recording the lives of the
patriarchs, say anything relative to its observance.
Yet in that one book are crowded the events of
two thousand three hundred and seventy years.
What then should they say of the fact that six
successive books of the Bible, relating with comparative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
minuteness the events of five hundred
years, and involving many circumstances that
would call out a mention of the Sabbath, do not
mention it at all? Does the silence of one book,
which nevertheless does give the institution of
the Sabbath at its very commencement, and which
brings into its record almost twenty-four hundred
years, prove that there were no Sabbath-keepers
prior to Moses? What then is proved by the
fact that six successive books of the Bible, confining
themselves to the events of five hundred
years, an average of less than one hundred years
apiece, the whole period covered by them being
about one-fifth that embraced in the book of
Genesis, do nevertheless preserve total silence respecting
the Sabbath?</p>

<p>No one will adduce this silence as evidence of
total neglect of the Sabbath during this period;
yet why should they not? Is it because that
when the narrative after this long silence brings
in the Sabbath again, it does this incidentally and
not as a new institution? Precisely such is the
case with the second mention of the Sabbath in
the Mosaic record, that is, with its mention after
the silence in Genesis.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Is it because the fourth
commandment had been given to the Hebrews
whereas no such precept had previously been
given to mankind? This answer cannot be admitted,
for we have seen that the substance of the
fourth commandment was given to the head of
the human family; and it is certain that when
the Hebrews came out of Egypt they were under
obligation to keep the Sabbath in consequence of
existing law.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The argument therefore is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
more conclusive that there were no Sabbath-keepers
from Moses to David, than that
there were none from Adam to Moses; yet no
one will attempt to maintain the first position,
however many there will be to affirm the latter.</p>

<p>Several facts are narrated in the history of this
period of five centuries that have a claim to our
notice. The first of these is found in the record
of the siege of Jericho.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> By the command of
God the city was encompassed by the Hebrews
each day for seven days; on the last day of the
seven they encompassed it seven times, when by
divine interposition the walls were thrown down
before them and the city taken by assault.
One day of this seven must have been the Sabbath
of the Lord. Did not the people of God
therefore violate the Sabbath in their acting
thus? Let the following facts answer: 1. That
which they did in this case was by direct command
of God. 2. That which is forbidden in the
fourth commandment is <span class="smcap">our own</span> work: “Six
days shalt thou labor, and do <span class="smcap">all thy work</span>; but
the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God.” He who reserved the seventh day unto
himself, had the right to require its appropriation
to his service as he saw fit. 3. The act of encompassing
the city was strictly as a <i>religious</i> procession.
The ark of the covenant of the Lord
was borne before the people; and before the ark
went seven priests blowing with trumpets of
rams’ horns. 4. Nor could the city have been
very extensive, else the going round it seven times
on the last day, and their having time left for its
complete destruction, would have been impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
5. Nor can it be believed that the Hebrews,
by God’s command carrying the ark before them,
which contained simply the ten words of the
Most High, were violating the fourth of those
words, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it
holy.” It is certain that one of those seven days
on which they encompassed Jericho was the Sabbath;
but there is no necessity for supposing this
to have been the day in which the city was taken.
Nor is this a reasonable conjecture when all the
facts in the case are considered. On this incident
Dr. Clarke remarks as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It does not appear that there could be any breach in
the Sabbath by the people simply going round the city,
the ark in company, and the priests sounding the sacred
trumpets. This was a mere religious procession, performed
at the command of God, in which no servile work
was done.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At the word of Joshua it pleased God to arrest
the earth in its revolution, and thus to cause the
sun to remain stationary for a season, that the
Canaanites might be overthrown before Israel.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
Did not this great miracle derange the Sabbath?
Not at all; for the lengthening of one of the six
days by God’s intervention could not prevent
the actual arrival of the seventh day, though it
would delay it; nor could it destroy its identity.
The case involves a difficulty for those who hold
the theory that God sanctified the seventh part
of time, and not the seventh day; for in this case
the seventh part of time was not allotted to the
Sabbath; but there is no difficulty involved for
those who believe that God set apart the seventh
day to be kept as it arrives, in memory of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
own rest. One of the six days was allotted a
greater length than ever before or since; yet this
did not in the slightest degree conflict with the
seventh day, which nevertheless did come. Moreover
all this was while inspired men were upon
the stage of action; and it was by the direct
providence of God; and what is also to be particularly
remembered, it was at a time when no
one will deny that the fourth commandment was
in full force.</p>

<p>The case of David’s eating the shew-bread is
worthy of notice, as it probably took place upon
the Sabbath, and because it is cited by our Lord
in a memorable conversation with the Pharisees.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
The law of the shew-bread enjoined the setting
forth of twelve loaves in the sanctuary upon the
pure table before the Lord <span class="smcap">every</span> Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
When new bread was thus placed before the Lord
each Sabbath, the old was taken away to be
eaten by the priests.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> It appears that the shew-bread
which was given to David had that day
been taken from before the Lord to put hot
bread in its place, and consequently that day was
the Sabbath. Thus, when David asked bread, the
priest said, “There is no common bread under
mine hand, but there is hallowed bread.” And
David said, “The bread is in a manner common,
especially [as the margin has it] when <span class="smcap">this day</span>
there is other sanctified in the vessel.” And so
the sacred writer adds: “The priest gave him
hallowed bread; for there was no bread there
but the shew-bread, that was taken from before
the Lord, to put hot bread in the day when it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
was taken away.” The circumstances of this
case all favor the view that this was upon the
Sabbath. 1. There was <span class="smcap">no common</span> bread with
the priest. This is not strange when it is remembered
that the shew-bread was to be taken
from before the Lord each Sabbath and eaten by
the priests. 2. That the priest did not offer to
<i>prepare</i> other bread is not singular if it be understood
that this was the Sabbath. 3. The
surprise of the priest in meeting David may have
been in part owing to the fact that it was the
Sabbath. 4. This also may account for the detention
of Doeg that day before the Lord. 5.
When our Lord was called upon to pronounce
upon the conduct of his disciples who had plucked
and eaten the ears of corn upon the Sabbath to
satisfy their hunger, he cited this case of David,
and that of the priests offering sacrifices in
the temple upon the Sabbath as justifying the
disciples. There is a wonderful propriety and
fitness in this citation, if it be understood that
this act of David’s took place upon the Sabbath.
It will be found to present the matter in a very
different light from that in which anti-Sabbatarians
present it.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>A distinction may be here pointed out, which
should never be lost sight of. The presentation of
the shew-bread and the offering of burnt sacrifices
upon the Sabbath as ordained in the ceremonial
law, formed no part of the original Sabbatic
institution. For the Sabbath was made before
the fall of man; while burnt-offerings and ceremonial
rites in the sanctuary were introduced in
consequence of the fall. While these rites were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
in force they necessarily, to some extent, connected
the Sabbath with the festivals of the Jews
in which the like offerings were made. This is
seen only in those scriptures which record the
provision made for these offerings.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> When the
ceremonial law was nailed to the cross, all the
Jewish festivals ceased to exist; for they were
ordained by it;<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> but the abrogation of that law
could only take away those rites which it had
appended to the Sabbath, leaving the original
institution precisely as it came at first from its
author.</p>

<p>The earliest reference to the Sabbath after the
days of Moses is found in what David and Samuel
ordained respecting the offices of the priests
and Levites at the house of God. It is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites,
were over the shew-bread, to prepare it every
Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed that this is only an incidental
mention of the Sabbath. Such an allusion,
occurring after so long a silence, is decisive proof
that the Sabbath had not been forgotten or lost
during the five centuries in which it had not been
mentioned by the sacred historians. After this
no direct mention of the Sabbath is found from
the days of David to those of Elisha the prophet,
a period of about one hundred and fifty years.
Perhaps the ninety-second psalm is an exception
to this statement, as its title, both in Hebrew and
English, declares that it was written for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Sabbath day;<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and it is not improbable that it
was composed by David, the sweet singer of
Israel.</p>

<p>The son of the Shunammite woman being dead,
she sought the prophet Elisha. Her husband not
knowing that the child was dead said to her:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? It is neither
new moon, nor Sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is probable that the Sabbath of the Lord is
here intended, as it is thrice used in a like connection.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
If this be correct, it shows that the Hebrews
were accustomed to visit the prophets of
God upon that day for divine instruction; a very
good commentary upon the words used relative
to gathering the manna: “Let no man go out of
his place on the seventh day.”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Incidental allusion
is made to the Sabbath at the accession of
Jehoash to the throne of Judah,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> about <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 778.
In the reign of Uzziah, the grandson of Jehoash,
the prophet Amos, <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 787, uses the following
language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to
make the poor of the land to fail, saying, When will the
new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the Sabbath,
that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances
by deceit? that we may buy the poor for silver, and the
needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the
wheat?”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These words were spoken more directly concerning
the ten tribes, and indicate the sad state
of apostasy which soon after resulted in their
overthrow as a people. About fifty years after
this, at the close of the reign of Ahaz, another
allusion to the Sabbath is found.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> In the days
of Hezekiah, about <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 712, the prophet Isaiah
uses the following language in enforcing the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment and do justice;
for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness
to be revealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this,
and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the
Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing
any evil. Neither let the son of the stranger, that
hath joined himself to the Lord, speak, saying, The Lord
hath utterly separated me from his people; neither let the
eunuch say, Behold I am a dry tree. For thus saith the Lord
unto the eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths, and choose the
things that please me, and take hold of my covenant, even
unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls,
a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters;
I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut
off. Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves
to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the
Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the Sabbath
from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make
them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt-offerings
and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for
mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.
The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel
saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those
that are gathered unto him.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This prophecy presents several features of peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
interest. 1. It pertains to a time when
the salvation of God is near at hand.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> 2. It most
distinctly shows that the Sabbath is not a Jewish
institution; for it pronounces a blessing upon
that man without respect of nationality who shall
keep the Sabbath; and it then particularizes the
son of the stranger, that is, the Gentile,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and
makes a peculiar promise to him if he will keep
the Sabbath. 3. And this prophecy relates to
Israel when they are outcasts, that is, when they
are in their dispersion, promising to gather them,
and <i>others</i>, that is, the Gentiles, with them. Of
course the condition of being gathered to God’s
holy mountain must be complied with, namely,
to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants,
and to keep the Sabbath from polluting it.
4. And hence it follows that the Sabbath is not a
local institution, susceptible of being observed in
the promised land alone, like the annual sabbaths,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
but one made for mankind and capable of being
observed by the outcasts of Israel when scattered
in every land under heaven.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Isaiah again presents the Sabbath; and this he
does in language most emphatically distinguishing
it from all ceremonial institutions. Thus he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from
doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath
a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor
him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou
delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride
upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord
hath spoken it.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This language is an evangelical commentary
upon the fourth commandment. It appends to
it an exceeding great and precious promise that
takes hold upon the land promised to Jacob, even
the new earth.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>In the year <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 601, thirteen years before the
destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, God
made to the Jewish people through Jeremiah the
gracious offer, that if they would keep his Sabbath,
their city should stand forever. At the
same time he testified unto them that if they
would not do this, their city should be utterly
destroyed. Thus said the prophet:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of Judah, and
all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter
in by these gates: Thus saith the Lord: Take heed to
yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor
bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> neither carry forth
a burden<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> out of your houses on the Sabbath day, neither
do ye any work, but hallow ye the Sabbath day, as I
commanded your fathers. But they obeyed not, neither
inclined their ears, but made their necks stiff, that they
might not hear, nor receive instruction.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> And it shall
come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the
Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city
on the Sabbath day, but hallow the Sabbath day, to do no
work therein; then shall there enter into the gates of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David,
riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes,
the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
and this city shall <span class="smcap">remain forever</span>. And they
shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places
about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and
from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the
south, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meat-offerings,
and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise,
unto the house of the Lord. But if ye will not hearken
unto me to hallow the Sabbath day, and not to bear a
burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the
Sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof,
and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall
not be quenched.”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This gracious offer of the Most High to his rebellious
people was not regarded by them; for
eight years after this Ezekiel testifies thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In thee have they set light by father and mother: in
the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the
stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the
widow. Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast
profaned my Sabbaths.... Her priests have violated
my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have
put no difference between the holy and profane, neither
have they showed difference between the unclean and the
clean, and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I
am profaned among them.... Moreover this they
have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in
the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths. For
when they had slain their children to their idols, then
they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it;
and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Idolatry and Sabbath-breaking, which were besetting
sins with the Hebrews in the wilderness,
and which there laid the foundation for their dispersion
from their own land,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> had ever cleaved
unto them. And now when their destruction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
was impending from the overwhelming power of
the king of Babylon, they were so deeply attached
to these and kindred sins, that they would not
regard the voice of warning. Before entering the
sanctuary of God upon his Sabbath, they first
slew their own children in sacrifice to their idols!<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Thus iniquity came to its hight, and wrath came
upon them to the uttermost.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They mocked the messengers of God, and despised
his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of
the Lord arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
Therefore he brought upon them the king of the
Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in
the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion
upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that
stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand. And all
the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures
of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to
Babylon, and they burnt the house of God, and brake down
the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof
with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
And them that had escaped from the sword carried he
away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and
his sons until the reign of the king of Persia.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

</div>

<p>While the Hebrews were in captivity at Babylon,
God made to them an offer of restoring them
to their own land and giving them again a city
and a temple under circumstances of wonderful
glory.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The condition of that offer being disregarded,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
the offered glory was never inherited by
them. In this offer were several allusions to the
Sabbath of the Lord, and also to the festivals of
the Hebrews.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> One of these allusions is worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
of particular notice for the distinctness with
which it discriminates between the Sabbath and
the other days of the week:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus saith the Lord God: The gate of the inner
court that looketh toward the east, shall be shut <span class="smcap">the six
working days</span>; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened,
and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.”<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Six days of the week are by divine inspiration
called “the six working days;” the seventh is
called the Sabbath of the Lord. Who shall dare
confound this marked distinction?</p>

<p>After the Jews had returned from their captivity
in Babylon, and had restored their temple
and city, in a solemn assembly of the whole people
they recount in an address to the Most High
all the great events of God’s providence in their
past history. Thus they testify respecting the
Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thou camest down also upon Mount Sinai, and spakest
with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments,
and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
and madest known unto them thy holy Sabbath, and commandest
them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand
of Moses thy servant.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus were all the people reminded of the great
events of Mount Sinai—the giving of the ten
words of the law of God, and the making known
of his holy Sabbath. So deeply impressed was
the whole congregation with the effect of their
former disobedience, that they entered into a solemn
covenant to obey God.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> They pledged
themselves to each other thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals
on the Sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
it of them on the Sabbath, or on the holy day; and that
we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of
every debt.”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the absence of Nehemiah at the Persian
court, this covenant was in part, at least, forgotten.
Eleven years having elapsed, Nehemiah
thus testifies concerning things at his return about
<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 434:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine-presses
on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading
asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner
of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the
Sabbath day; and I testified against them in the day wherein
they sold victuals. There dwelt men of Tyre also therein,
which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on
the Sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto
them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the
Sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not
our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city?
yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the
Sabbath. And it came to pass, that, when the gates of
Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> I commanded
that the gates should be shut, and charged that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
they should not be opened till after the Sabbath: and
some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should
no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day. So the
merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
Jerusalem once or twice. Then I testified against them,
and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if
ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time
forth came they no more on the Sabbath. And I commanded
the Levites that they should cleanse themselves,
and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify
the Sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning
this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy
mercy.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This scripture is an explicit testimony that the
destruction of Jerusalem and the captivity of the
Jews at Babylon were in consequence of their profanation
of the Sabbath. It is a striking confirmation
of the language of Jeremiah, already
noticed, in which he testified to the Jews that if
they would hallow the Sabbath their city should
stand forever; but that it should be utterly destroyed
if they persisted in its profanation. Nehemiah
bears testimony to the accomplishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of Jeremiah’s prediction concerning the violation
of the Sabbath; and with his solemn appeal in
its behalf ends the history of the Sabbath in the
Old Testament.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SABBATH FROM NEHEMIAH TO CHRIST.</span></h3>

<p>Great change in the Jewish people respecting idolatry and
Sabbath-breaking after their return from Babylon—Decree
of Antiochus Epiphanes against the Sabbath—Massacre of
a thousand Sabbath-keepers in the wilderness—Similar
massacre at Jerusalem—Decree of the Jewish elders relative
to resisting attacks upon the Sabbath—Other martyrdoms—Victories
of Judas Maccabeus—How Pompey captured
Jerusalem—Teaching of the Jewish doctors respecting
the Sabbath—State of the Sabbatic institution at the
first advent of the Saviour.</p>

</div>

<p>The period of almost five centuries intervenes
between the time of Nehemiah and the commencement
of the ministry of the Redeemer.
During this time an extraordinary change came
over the Jewish people. Previously, they had
been to an alarming extent idolaters, and outbreaking
violators of the Sabbath. But after
their return from Babylon they were never guilty
of idolatry to any extent, the chastisement of
that captivity effecting a cure of this evil.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In
like manner did they change their conduct relative
to the Sabbath; and during this period they
loaded the Sabbatic institution with the most
burdensome and rigorous ordinances. A brief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
survey of this period must suffice. Under the
reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, the king of Syria,
<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 170, the Jews were greatly oppressed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“King Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all
should be one people, and every one should leave his
laws: so all the heathen agreed according to the commandment
of the king. Yea, many also of the Israelites consented
to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned
the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The greater part of the Hebrews remained
faithful to God, and, as a consequence, were
obliged to flee for their lives. Thus the historian
continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Then many that sought after justice and judgment
went down into the wilderness, to dwell there: both they,
and their children, and their wives, and their cattle; because
afflictions increased sore upon them. Now when it
was told the king’s servants, and the host that was at
Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who
had broken the king’s commandment, were gone down
into the secret places in the wilderness, they pursued after
them a great number, and having overtaken them, they
camped against them, and made war against them on the
Sabbath day. And they said unto them, Let that which
ye have done hitherto suffice; come forth, and do according
to the commandment of the king, and ye shall live.
But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do
the king’s commandment, to profane the Sabbath day.
So then they gave them the battle with all speed. Howbeit
they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at
them, nor stopped the places where they lay hid. But
said, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earth
shall testify for us, that ye put us to death wrongfully.
So they rose up against them in battle on the Sabbath,
and they slew them, with their wives and children, and
their cattle, to the number of a thousand people.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In Jerusalem itself a like massacre took place.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
King Antiochus sent Appollonius with an army
of twenty-two thousand,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Who, coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did
forbear till the holy day of the Sabbath, when taking the
Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to arm
themselves. And so he slew all them that were gone to
the celebrating of the Sabbath, and running through the
city with weapons, slew great multitudes.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In view of these dreadful acts of slaughter,
Mattathias, “an honorable and great man,” the
father of Judas Maccabeus, with his friends decreed
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whosoever shall come to make battle with us on the
Sabbath day we will fight against him; neither will we
die all, as our brethren that were murdered in the secret
places.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Yet were some martyred after this for observing
the Sabbath. Thus we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And others, that had run together into caves near
by, to keep the Sabbath day secretly, being discovered to
Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a
conscience to help themselves for the honor of the most
sacred day.”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After this, Judas Maccabeus did great exploits
in defense of the Hebrews, and in resisting the
dreadful oppression of the Syrian government.
Of one of these battles we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When he had given them this watchword, <i>The help
of God</i>, himself leading the first band, he joined battle
with Nicanor. And by the help of the Almighty they slew
above nine thousand of their enemies, and wounded and
maimed the most part of Nicanor’s host, and so put all
to flight; and took their money that came to buy them,
and pursued them far; but lacking time, they returned:
for it was the day before the Sabbath, and therefore they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
would no longer pursue them. So when they had gathered
their armor together, and spoiled their enemies, they
occupied themselves about the Sabbath, yielding exceeding
praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved
them unto that day, which was the beginning of mercy
distilling upon them. And after the Sabbath, when they
had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows,
and orphans, the residue they divided among themselves
and their servants.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After this the Hebrews being attacked upon
the Sabbath by their enemies, defeated them
with much slaughter.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>About <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 63, Jerusalem was besieged and
taken by Pompey, the general of the Romans.
To do this, it was necessary to fill an immense
ditch, and to raise against the city a bank on
which to place the engines of assault. Thus Josephus
relates the event:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And had it not been our practice, from the days of our
forefathers, to rest on the seventh day, this bank could
never have been perfected, by reason of the opposition
the Jews would have made; for though our law gives us
leave then to defend ourselves against those that begin
to fight with us, and assault us, yet does it not permit us
to meddle with our enemies while they do anything else.
Which thing when the Romans understood, on those days
which we call Sabbaths, they threw nothing at the Jews,
nor came to any pitched battle with them, but raised up
their earthen banks, and brought their engines into such
forwardness, that they might do execution the next
days.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>From this it is seen that Pompey carefully refrained
from any attack upon the Jews on each
Sabbath during the siege, but spent that day in
filling the ditch and raising the bank, that he
might attack them on the day following each
Sabbath, that is, upon Sunday. Josephus further
relates that the priests were not at all hindered
from their sacred ministrations by the stones
thrown among them from the engines of Pompey,
even “if any melancholy accident happened;”
and that when the city was taken and the enemy
fell upon them, and cut the throats of those that
were in the temples, yet did not the priests run
away or desist from the offering of the accustomed
sacrifices.</p>

<p>These quotations from Jewish history are sufficient
to indicate the extraordinary change that
came over that people concerning the Sabbath,
after the Babylonish captivity. A brief view of
the teaching of the Jewish doctors respecting the
Sabbath at the time when our Lord began his
ministry will conclude this chapter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They enumerated about forty primary works, which
they said were forbidden to be done on the Sabbath.
Under each of these were numerous secondary works,
which they said were also forbidden.... Among
the primary works which were forbidden, were ploughing,
sowing, reaping, winnowing, cleaning, grinding, etc. Under
the head of grinding, was included the breaking or
dividing of things which were before united....
Another of their traditions was, that, as threshing on the
Sabbath was forbidden, the bruising of things, which was
a species of threshing, was also forbidden. Of course, it
was violation of the Sabbath to walk on green grass,
for that would bruise or thresh it. So, as a man might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
not hunt on the Sabbath, he might not catch a flea; for
that was a species of hunting. As a man might not carry
a burden on the Sabbath, he might not carry water to a
thirsty animal, for that was a species of burden; but he
might pour water into a trough, and lead the animal to
it.... Yet should a sheep fall into a pit, they would
readily lift him out, and bear him to a place of safety....
They said a man might minister to the sick for
the purpose of relieving their distress, but not for the
purpose of healing their diseases. He might put a covering
on a diseased eye, or anoint it with eye-salve for
the purpose of easing the pain, but not to cure the eye.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was the remarkable change in the conduct
of the Jewish people toward the Sabbath;
and such was the teaching of their doctors respecting
it. The most merciful institution of God
for mankind had become a source of distress; that
which God ordained as a delight and a source of
refreshment had become a yoke of bondage; the
Sabbath, made for man in paradise, was now a
most oppressive and burdensome institution. It
was time that God should interfere. Next upon
the scene of action appears the Lord of the Sabbath.</p>

</div>

<p>In the fullness of time God sent forth his Son
to be the Saviour of the world. He who fulfilled
this mission of infinite benevolence was both the
Son of God and the Son of man. He was with
the Father before the world was, and by him God
created all things.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The Sabbath being ordained
at the close of that great work as a memorial to
keep it in lasting remembrance, the Son of God,
by whom all things were created, could not be
otherwise than a perfect judge of its true design,
and of its proper observance. The sixty-nine
weeks of Daniel’s prophecy being accomplished,
the Redeemer began to preach, saying, “The time
is fulfilled.”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The ministry of the Saviour was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
at a time when the Sabbath of the Lord had become
utterly perverted from its gracious design,
by the teaching of the Jewish doctors. As we
have seen in the previous chapter, it was to the
people no longer a source of refreshment and
delight, but a cause of suffering and distress. It
had been loaded down with traditions by the
doctors of the law until its merciful and beneficent
design was utterly hidden beneath the rubbish
of men’s inventions. It being impracticable
for Satan, after the Babylonish captivity, to cause
the Jewish people, even by bloody edicts, to
relinquish the Sabbath and openly to profane it
as before that time, he turned their doctors so to
pervert it, that its real character should be utterly
changed and its observance entirely unlike
that which would please God. We shall find
that the Saviour never missed an opportunity to
correct their false notions respecting the Sabbath;
and that he selected, with evident design, the
Sabbath as the day on which to perform many of
his merciful works. It will be found that no
small share of his teaching through his whole
ministry was devoted to a determination of what
was lawful on the Sabbath, a singular fact for
those to explain who think that he designed its
abrogation. At the opening of our Lord’s ministry,
we read thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into
Galilee; and there went out a fame of him through all
the region round about. And he taught in their synagogues,
being glorified of all. And he came to Nazareth,
where he had been brought up; and, as his custom was,
he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and
stood up for to read.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>Such was the manner of the Saviour relative
to the Sabbath. It is evident that in this he
designed to show his regard for that day; for it
was not necessary thus to do in order to gain a
congregation, as vast multitudes were ever ready
to throng his steps. His testimony being rejected,
our Lord left Nazareth for Capernaum.
Thus the sacred historian says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But he, passing through the midst of them, went his
way, and came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and
taught them on the Sabbath days. And they were astonished
at his doctrine; for his word was with power.
And in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit
of an unclean devil; and he cried out with a loud voice,
saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou
Jesus of Nazareth; art thou come to destroy us? I know
thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. And Jesus
rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst,
he came out of him, and hurt him not. And they were
all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a
word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth
the unclean spirits, and they come out. And the
fame of him went out into every place of the country
round about. And he arose out of the synagogue, and
entered into Simon’s house. And Simon’s wife’s mother
was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for
her. And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and
it left her; and immediately she arose and ministered
unto them.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These miracles are the first which stand upon
record as performed by the Saviour upon the
Sabbath. But the strictness of Jewish views relative
to the Sabbath is seen in that they waited
till sunset, that is, till the Sabbath was passed,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
before they brought the sick to be healed. Thus
it is added:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And at even when the sun did set, they brought unto
him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed
with devils. And all the city was gathered together at
the door. And he healed many that were sick of divers
diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the
devils to speak, because they knew him.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The next mention of the Sabbath is of peculiar
interest:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through
the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began
to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat. But when the
Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold thy disciples
do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath
day. But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David
did, when he was an hungered, and they that were
with him; how he entered into the house of God, and did
eat the shew-bread, which was not lawful for him to eat,
neither for them which were with him, but only for the
priests? Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the
Sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath,
and are blameless? But I say unto you that in this
place is one greater than the temple. But if ye had
known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice,
ye would not have condemned the guiltless. For
the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The parallel text in Mark has an important addition
to the conclusion as stated by Matthew:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for
man, and not man for the Sabbath; therefore the Son of
man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The following points should be noted in examining
this text:—</p>

<p>1. That the question at issue did not relate to
the act of passing through the corn on the Sabbath;
for the Pharisees themselves were in the
company; and hence it may be concluded that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
the Saviour and those with him were either going
to, or returning from, the synagogue.</p>

<p>2. That the question raised by the Pharisees
was this: Whether the disciples, in satisfying
their hunger from the corn through which they
were passing, were not violating the law of the
Sabbath.</p>

<p>3. That he to whom this question was proposed
was in the highest degree competent to
answer it; for he was with the Father when the
Sabbath was made.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>4. That the Saviour was pleased to appeal to
scriptural precedents for the decision of this question,
rather than to assert his own independent
judgment.</p>

<p>5. That the first case cited by the Saviour was
peculiarly appropriate. David, fleeing for his life,
entered the house of God upon the Sabbath,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
and ate the shew-bread to satisfy his hunger.
The disciples, to relieve their hunger, simply
ate of the corn through which they were passing
upon the Sabbath. If David did right, though
eating in his necessity of that which belonged
only to the priests, how little of blame could be
attached to the disciples who had not even violated
a precept of the ceremonial law? Thus
much for the disciples’ satisfying their hunger as
they did upon the Sabbath. Our Lord’s next
example is designed to show what labor upon
the Sabbath is not a violation of its sacredness.</p>

<p>6. And hence the case of the priests is cited.
The same God who had said in the fourth commandment,
“Six days shalt thou labor and do all
<span class="smcap">thy</span> work,” had commanded that the priests upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the Sabbath should offer certain sacrifices in his
temple.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Herein was no contradiction; for the labor performed
by the priests upon the Sabbath was simply
the maintenance of the appointed worship
of God in his temple, and was not doing what
the commandment calls “<span class="smcap">thy work</span>.” Labor of
this kind, therefore, the Saviour being judge, was
not, and never had been, a violation of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>7. But it is highly probable that the Saviour,
in this reference to the priests, had his mind not
merely upon the sacrifices which they offered
upon the Sabbath, but upon the fact that they
were required to prepare new shew-bread every
Sabbath; when the old was to be removed from
the table before the Lord and eaten by them.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
This view of the matter would connect the case
of the priests with that of David, and both would
bear with wonderful distinctness upon the act of
the disciples. Then our Lord’s argument could
be appreciated when he adds: “But I say unto
you, That in this place is one greater than the
temple.” So that if the shew-bread was to be
prepared each Sabbath for the use of those who
ministered in the temple, and those who did this
were guiltless, how free from guilt also must be
the disciples who, in following <span class="smcap">Him</span> that was
greater than the temple, but who had not where to
lay his head, had eaten of the standing corn upon
the Sabbath to relieve their hunger?</p>

<p>8. But our Lord next lays down a principle
worthy of the most serious attention. Thus he
adds: “But if ye had known what this meaneth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not
have condemned the guiltless.” The Most High
had ordained certain labor to be performed upon
the Sabbath, in order that sacrifices might be offered
to himself. But Christ affirms upon the
authority of the Scriptures,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> that there is something
far more acceptable to God than sacrifices,
and that this is acts of mercy. If God held those
guiltless who offered sacrifices upon the Sabbath,
how much less would he condemn those who extend
mercy and relief to the distressed and suffering,
upon that day.</p>

<p>9. Nor does the Saviour even leave the subject
here; for he adds: “The Sabbath was made for
man, and not man for the Sabbath; therefore the
Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” If the
Sabbath was <i>made</i>, certain acts were necessary
in order to give existence to it. What were
those acts? (1) God rested upon the seventh
day. This made the seventh day the rest-day or
Sabbath of the Lord. (2) He blessed the day;
thus it became his holy day. (3) He sanctified
it, or set it apart to a holy use; thus its
observance became a part of man’s duty toward
God. There must be a time when these acts
were performed. And on this point there is
really no room for controversy. They were not
performed at Sinai, nor in the wilderness of Sin,
but in paradise. And this is strikingly confirmed
by the language here used by the Saviour: “The
Sabbath was made for <span class="smcap">the</span> man, not <span class="smcap">the</span> man for
the Sabbath;”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> thus citing our minds to the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
Adam that was made of the dust of the ground,
and affirming that the Sabbath was made for
him; a conclusive testimony that the Sabbath
originated in paradise. This fact is happily illustrated
by a statement of the apostle Paul:
“Neither was the man created for the woman;
but the woman for the man.”<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> It will not be
denied that this language has direct reference to
the creation of Adam and Eve. If then we turn
back to the beginning, we shall find Adam made
of the dust of the ground, Eve taken from his
side, and the Sabbath made of the seventh day.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Thus the Saviour, to complete the solution of the
question raised by the Pharisees, traces the Sabbath
back to the beginning, as he does the institution
of marriage when the same class proposed
for his decision the lawfulness of divorce.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
His careful statement of the design of the Sabbath
and of marriage, tracing each to the beginning,
in the one case striking down their perversion
of the Sabbath, in the other, that of marriage,
is the most powerful testimony in behalf of the
sacredness of each institution. The argument in
the one case stands thus: In the beginning God
created <i>one</i> man and <i>one</i> woman, designing that
they two should be one flesh. The marriage relation
therefore was designed to unite simply two
persons, and this union <i>should</i> be sacred and indissoluble.
Such was the bearing of his argument
upon the question of divorce. In relation
to the Sabbath, his argument is this: God made
the Sabbath for the man that he made of the dust
of the ground; and being thus made for an unfallen
race, it can only be a merciful and beneficent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
institution. He who made the Sabbath for
man before the fall saw what man needed, and
knew how to supply that want. It was given to
him for rest, refreshment, and delight; a character
that it sustained after the fall,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> but which the
Jews had wholly lost sight of.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> And thus our
Lord lays open his whole heart concerning the
Sabbath. He carefully determines what works
are not a violation of the Sabbath; and this he
does by Old-Testament examples, that it may be
evident that he is introducing no change in the
institution; he sets aside their rigorous and burdensome
traditions concerning the Sabbath, by
tracing it back to its merciful origin in paradise;
and having thus disencumbered the Sabbath of
Pharisaic rigor, he leaves it upon its paradisiacal
foundation, enforced by all the authority and sacredness
of that law which he came not to destroy,
but to magnify and make honorable.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>10. Having thus divested the Sabbath of all
Pharisaic additions, our Lord concludes with this
remarkable declaration: “Therefore the Son of
man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” (1) It was
not a disparagement to the Sabbath, but an honor,
that God’s only Son should claim to be its Lord.
(2) Nor was it derogatory to the character of the
Redeemer to be the Lord of the Sabbath; with
all the high honors pertaining to his messiahship
he is <span class="smcap">also</span> Lord of the Sabbath. Or, if we take
the expression in Matthew, he is “Lord <span class="smcap">even</span> of
the Sabbath day,” it implies that it is not a small
honor to possess such a title. (3) This title implies
that the Messiah should be the <i>protector</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
and not the <i>destroyer</i>, of the Sabbath. And
hence that he was the rightful being to decide
the proper nature of Sabbatic observance. With
these memorable words ends our Lord’s first discourse
concerning the Sabbath.</p>

<p>From this time the Pharisees watched the Saviour
to find an accusation against him of violating
the Sabbath. The next example will show the
malignity of their hearts, their utter perversion
of the Sabbath, the urgent need of an authoritative
correction of their false teachings respecting it,
and the Saviour’s unanswerable defense:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And when he was departed thence, he went into their
synagogue: and behold there was a man which had his
hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful
to heal on the Sabbath days? that they might accuse
him. And he said unto them, What man shall there be
among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit
on the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it
out? How much then is a man better than a sheep?
Wherefore, it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days.
Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And
he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as
the other. Then the Pharisees went out and held a council
against him, how they might destroy him.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What was the act that caused this madness of
the Pharisees? On the part of the Saviour, it
was a word; on the part of the man, it was the
act of stretching out his arm. Did the law of the
Sabbath forbid either of these things? No one
can affirm such a thing. But the Saviour had
publicly transgressed that tradition of the Pharisees
that forbade the doing of anything whatever
toward the healing of the sick upon the Sabbath.
And how necessary that such a wicked tradition
should be swept away, if the Sabbath itself was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
to be preserved for man. But the Pharisees were
filled with such madness that they went out of
the synagogue and consulted how they might
destroy the Saviour. Yet Jesus only acted in
behalf of the Sabbath in setting aside those traditions
by which they had perverted it.</p>

<p>After this, our Lord returned into his own
country, and thus we read of him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And when the Sabbath day was come, he began to
teach in the synagogue; and many hearing him were astonished,
saying, From whence hath this man these
things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him,
that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Not far from this time we find the Saviour at
Jerusalem, and the following miracle was performed
upon the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And a certain man was there which had an infirmity
thirty and eight years. When Jesus saw him lie, and
knew that he had been there now a long time in that case,
he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? The impotent
man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the
water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I
am coming, another steppeth down before me. Jesus saith
unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. And immediately
the man was made whole, and took up his bed
and walked; and on the same day was the Sabbath. The
Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
Sabbath day: It is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
He answered them, He that made me whole, the same
said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. Then asked
they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take
up thy bed, and walk?... The man departed and
told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him
whole. And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and
sought to slay him, because he had done these things on
the Sabbath day. But Jesus answered them, My Father
worketh hitherto, and I work. Therefore the Jews sought
the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making
himself equal with God.”<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Our Lord here stands charged with two crimes:
1. He had broken the Sabbath. 2. He had made
himself equal with God. The first accusation is
based on these particulars: (1) By his word he
had healed the impotent man. But this violated
no law of God; it only set at naught that tradition
which forbade anything to be done for curing
diseases upon the Sabbath. (2) He had directed
the man to carry his bed. But this as a burden
was a mere trifle,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> like a cloak or mat, and was
designed to show the reality of his cure, and thus
to honor the Lord of the Sabbath who had healed
him. Moreover, it was not such a burden as the
Scriptures forbid upon the Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> (3) Jesus
justified what he had done by comparing his
present act of healing to that work which his
Father had done <span class="smcap">hitherto</span>, <i>i. e.</i>, from the beginning
of the creation. Ever since the Sabbath was
sanctified in paradise, the Father, by his providence,
had continued to mankind, even upon the
Sabbath, all the merciful acts by which the human
race has been preserved. This work of the Father
was of precisely the same nature as that
which Jesus had now done. These acts did not
argue that the Father had <i>hitherto</i> lightly esteemed
the Sabbath, for he had most solemnly
enjoined its observance in the law and in the
prophets;<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and as our Lord had most expressly
recognized their authority,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> there was no ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
to accuse him of disregarding the Sabbath, when
he had only followed the example of the Father
from the beginning. The Saviour’s answer to
these two charges will remove all difficulty:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself,
but what he seeth the Father do; for what things
soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This answer involves two points: 1. That he
was following his Father’s perfect example, who
had ever laid open to him all his works; and
hence as he was doing that only which had ever
been the pleasure of the Father to do, he was not
engaged in the overthrow of the Sabbath. 2. And
by the meek humility of this answer—“The Son
can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the
Father do”—he showed the groundlessness of
their charge of self-exaltation. Thus, in nothing
was there left a chance to answer him again.</p>

<p>Several months after this, the same case of
healing was under discussion:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one
work, and ye all marvel. Moses therefore gave unto you
circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the
fathers); and ye on the Sabbath-day circumcise a man.
If a man on the Sabbath day receive circumcision, that the
law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me,
because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath
day?”<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This Scripture contains our Lord’s second answer
relative to healing the impotent man upon
the Sabbath. In his first answer he rested his
defense upon the fact that what he had done was
precisely the same as that which his Father had
done <i>hitherto</i>, that is, from the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
world; which implies that the Sabbath had existed
from the same point, else the example of
the Father during this time would not be relevant.
In this, his second answer, a similar point is involved
relative to the origin of the Sabbath. His
defense this time rests upon the fact that his act
of healing no more violated the Sabbath than did
the act of circumcising upon the Sabbath. But
if circumcision, which was ordained in the time of
Abraham, was older than the Sabbath—as it certainly
was if the Sabbath originated in the wilderness
of Sin—there would be an impropriety
in the allusion; for circumcision would be entitled
to the priority as the more ancient institution.
It would be strictly proper to speak of the
more recent institution as involving no violation
of an older one; but it would be otherwise to
speak of an ancient institution as involving no
violation of one more recent. The language therefore
implies that the Sabbath was older than circumcision;
in other words, more ancient than the
days of Abraham. These two answers of the
Saviour are certainly in harmony with the unanimous
testimony of the sacred writers, that the
Sabbath originated with the sanctification of the
rest-day of the Lord in Eden.</p>

<p>What had the Saviour done to justify the
hatred of the Jewish people toward him? He
had healed upon the Sabbath, with one word, a
man who had been helpless thirty-eight years.
Was not this act in strict accordance with the
Sabbatic institution? Our Lord has settled this
point in the affirmative by weighty and unanswerable
arguments,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> not in this case alone, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
in others already noticed, and also in those which
remain to be noticed. Had he left the man in
his wretchedness because it was the Sabbath,
when a word would have healed him, he would
have dishonored the Sabbath, and thrown reproach
upon its Author. We shall find the Lord
of the Sabbath still further at work in its behalf
in rescuing it from the hands of those who had
so utterly perverted its design; a work quite
unnecessary, had he designed to nail the institution
to his cross.</p>

<p>The next incident to be noticed is the case of
the man that was born blind. Jesus seeing him
said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I must work the works of him that sent me whilst it
is day; the night cometh when no man can work. As
long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
When he had thus spoken he spat on the ground, and
made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the
blind man with the clay, and said unto him, Go wash in
the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent).
He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing....
And it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made
the clay and opened his eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is the record of another of our Lord’s
merciful acts upon the Sabbath day. He saw a
man blind from his birth; moved with compassion
toward him, he moistened clay and anointed his
eyes, and sent him to the pool to wash; and when
he had washed he received sight. The act was
alike worthy of the Sabbath and of its Lord: and
it pertains only to the opponents of the Sabbath
<i>now</i>, as it pertained only to the enemies of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Lord <i>then</i>, to see in this even the slightest violation
of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>After this we read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the
Sabbath. And behold there was a woman which had a
spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together,
and could in no wise lift up herself. And when
Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,
Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And he
laid his hands on her; and immediately she was made
straight, and glorified God. And the ruler of the synagogue
answered with indignation, because that Jesus had
healed on the Sabbath day, and said unto the people,
There are six days in which men ought to work: in them
therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.
The Lord then answered him and said, Thou hypocrite,
doth not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or
his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?
And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham,
whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be
loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day? And when
he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed:
and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that
were done by him.”<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This time a daughter of Abraham, that is, a
pious woman,<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> who had been bound by Satan
eighteen years, was loosed from that bond upon
the Sabbath day. Jesus silenced the clamor of
his enemies by an appeal to their own course of
action in loosing the ox and leading him to water
upon the Sabbath. With this answer our Lord
made ashamed all his adversaries, and all the
people rejoiced for all the glorious things that
were done by him. The last of these glorious
acts with which Jesus honored the Sabbath is
thus narrated:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“And it came to pass as he went into the house of one
of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath day,
that they watched him. And, behold, there was a certain
man before him which had the dropsy. And Jesus answering
spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful
to heal on the Sabbath day? And they held their peace.
And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; and
answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or
an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him
out on the Sabbath day? And they could not answer
him again to these things.”<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is evident that the Pharisees and lawyers
durst not answer the question, Is it lawful to heal
on the Sabbath day? If they said, “Yes,” they
condemned their own tradition. If they said,
“No,” they were unable to sustain their answer
by fair argument. Hence they remained silent.
And when Jesus had healed the man, he asked a
second question equally embarrassing: Which of
you shall have an ox fall into a pit and will not
straightway pull him out on the Sabbath? They
could not answer him again to these things. It
is apparent that our Lord’s argument with the
Pharisees from time to time relative to the Sabbath
had satisfied them at last that silence relative
to their traditions was wiser than speech.
In his public teaching the Saviour declared that
the weightier matters of the law were judgment,
<span class="smcap">mercy</span>, and faith;<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and his long-continued and
powerful effort in behalf of the Sabbath, was to
vindicate it as a <span class="smcap">merciful</span> institution, and to rid
it of Pharisaic traditions, by which it was perverted
from its original purpose. Those who
oppose the Sabbath are here guilty of unfairness
in two particulars: 1. They represent these
Pharisaic rigors as actually belonging to the
Sabbatic institution. By this means they turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the minds of men against the Sabbath. 2. And
having done this they represent the effort of the
Saviour to set aside those traditions as directed
to the overthrow of the Sabbath itself.</p>

<p>And now we come to the Saviour’s memorable
discourse upon the mount of Olives, on the very
eve of his crucifixion, in which for the last time
he mentions the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the
holy place (whoso readeth, let him understand), then let
them which be in Judea flee into the mountains: let him
which is on the house-top not come down to take anything
out of his house; neither let him which is in the
field return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them
that are with child, and to them that give suck in those
days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,
neither on the Sabbath day; for then shall be great tribulation,
such as was not since the beginning of the world
to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this language our Lord brings to view the
dreadful calamities of the Jewish people, and the
destruction of their city and temple as predicted
by Daniel the prophet;<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and his watchful care over
his people as their Lord leads him to point out
their means of escape.</p>

<p>1. He gives them a token by which they should
know when this terrible overthrow was immediately
impending. It was “the abomination of
desolation” standing “in the holy place;” or, as
expressed by Luke, the token was “Jerusalem
compassed with armies.”<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The fulfillment of this
sign is recorded by the historian Josephus. After
stating that Cestius, the Roman commander, at
the commencement of the contest between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
Jews and the Romans, encompassed the city of
Jerusalem with an army, he adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Who, had he but continued the siege a little longer,
had certainly taken the city; but it was, I suppose,
owing to the aversion God had already at the city and
the sanctuary, that he was hindered from putting an end
to the war that very day. It then happened that Cestius
was not conscious either how the besieged despaired of
success, nor how courageous the people were for him;
and so he recalled his soldiers from the place, and by
despairing of any expectation of taking it, without having
received any disgrace, he retired from the city, without
any reason in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

</div>

<p>2. This sign being seen, the disciples were to
know that the desolation of Jerusalem was nigh.
“Then,” says Christ, “let them which be in Judea
flee into the mountains.” Josephus records the
fulfillment of this injunction:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After this calamity had befallen Cestius, many of the
most eminent of the Jews swam away from the city, as
from a ship when it was going to sink.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Eusebius also relates its fulfillment:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The whole body, however, of the church at Jerusalem,
having been commanded by a divine revelation,
given to men of approved piety there before the war, removed
from the city, and dwelt at a certain town beyond
the Jordan, called Pella. Here, those that believed in
Christ, having removed from Jerusalem, as if holy men
had entirely abandoned the royal city itself, and the
whole land of Judea; the divine justice for their crimes
against Christ and his apostles, finally overtook them,
totally destroying the whole generation of these evil-doers
from the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

</div>

<p>3. So imminent was the danger when this sign
should be seen that not a moment was to be lost.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
He that was upon the house-top could not even
come down to take a single article from his house.
The man that was in the field was forbidden to
return to the house for his clothes. Not a moment
was to be lost; they must flee as they were,
and flee for life. And pitiable indeed was the
case of those who could not flee.</p>

<p>4. In view of the fact that the disciples must
flee the moment that the promised token should
appear, our Lord directed them to pray for two
things: 1. That their flight should not be in the
winter. 2. That it should not be upon the Sabbath
day. Their pitiable situation should they
be compelled to flee to the mountains in the
depth of winter, without time to even take their
clothes, sufficiently attests the importance of the
first of these petitions, and the tender care of Jesus
as the Lord of his people. The second of
these petitions will be found equally expressive
of his care as Lord of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>5. But it is replied that this last petition has
reference only to the fact that the Jews would
then be keeping the Sabbath strictly, and as a
consequence the city gates would be closed that
day, and those be punished with death who
should attempt to flee; and hence this petition
indicates nothing in proof of Christ’s regard for
the Sabbath. An assertion so often and so confidently
uttered should be well founded in truth;
yet a brief examination will show that such is not
the case. 1. The Saviour’s language has reference
to the whole land of Judea, and not to Jerusalem
only: “Let them which be in Judea flee into the
mountains.” The closing of the city gates could
not therefore affect the flight of but a part of the
disciples. 2. Josephus states the remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
fact that when Cestius was marching upon Jerusalem
in fulfillment of the Saviour’s token, and
had reached Lydda, not many miles from Jerusalem,
“he found the city empty of its men; for the
whole multitude were gone up to Jerusalem to the
feast of tabernacles.”<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The law of Moses required
the presence of every male in Israel at this
feast in Jerusalem;<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and thus, in the providence
of God, the disciples had no Jewish enemies left
in the country to hinder their flight. 3. The
Jewish nation being thus assembled at Jerusalem
did most openly violate the Sabbath a few days
prior to the flight of the disciples; a singular
commentary on their supposed strictness in keeping
it at that time.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Thus Josephus says of the
march of Cestius upon Jerusalem that,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He pitched his camp at a certain place called Gabao,
fifty furlongs distant from Jerusalem. But as for the
Jews, when they saw the war approaching to their metropolis,
they left the feast, and betook themselves to
their arms; and taking courage greatly from their multitude,
went in a sudden and disorderly manner to the
fight, with a great noise, and without any consideration
had of the rest of the seventh day, although the Sabbath
was the day to which they had the greatest regard; but
that rage which made them forget the religious observation
[of the Sabbath] made them too hard for their enemies
in the fight; with such violence therefore did they
fall upon the Romans, as to break into their ranks, and
to march through the midst of them, making a great
slaughter as they went,”<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> etc.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus it is seen that on the eve of the disciples’
flight the rage of the Jews toward their enemies
made them utterly disregard the Sabbath! 4.
But after Cestius encompassed the city with his
army, thus giving the Saviour’s signal, he suddenly
withdrew it, as Josephus says, “without
any reason in the world.” This was the moment
of flight for the disciples, and mark how the providence
of God opened the way for those in Jerusalem:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But when the robbers perceived this unexpected retreat
of his, they resumed their courage, and ran after the
hinder parts of his army, and destroyed a considerable
number of both their horsemen and footmen: and now
Cestius lay all night at the camp which was at Scopus,
and as he went off farther next day, he thereby invited the
enemy to follow him, who still fell upon the hindmost
and destroyed them.”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This sally of the excited multitude in pursuit
of the Romans was at the very moment when the
disciples were commanded to flee, and could not
but afford them the needed facility of escape.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Had the flight of Cestius happened upon the
Sabbath, undoubtedly the Jews would have pursued
him upon that day, as under less exciting
circumstances they had a few days before gone
out several miles to attack him upon the Sabbath.
It is seen, therefore, that whether in city or country,
the disciples were not in danger of being attacked
by their enemies, even had their flight
been upon the Sabbath day.</p>

<p>6. There is therefore but one view that can
be taken relative to the meaning of these words
of our Lord, and that is that he thus spake, out
of sacred regard for the Sabbath. For in his tender
care for his people he had given them a precept
that would require them to violate the Sabbath,
should the moment for flight happen upon
that day. For the command to flee was imperative
the instant the promised signal should be
seen, and the distance to Pella, where they found
a place of refuge, was at least sixty miles. This
prayer which the Saviour left with the disciples
would cause them to remember the Sabbath whenever
they should come before God. It was therefore
impossible that the apostolic church should
forget the day of sacred rest. Such a prayer, that
they might not at a future time be compelled to
violate the Sabbath, was a sure and certain means
of perpetuating its sacred observance for the
coming forty years, until the final destruction of
Jerusalem, and was never forgotten by that early
church, as we shall hereafter see.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The Saviour,
who had taken unwearied pains during his whole
ministry to show that the Sabbath was a merciful
institution and to set aside those traditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
by which it had been perverted from its true design,
did, in this his last discourse, most tenderly
commend the Sabbath to his people, uniting in
the same petition their own safety and the sacredness
of the rest-day of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>A few days after this discourse, the Lord of the
Sabbath was nailed to the cross as the great sacrifice
for the sins of men.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The Messiah was thus
cut off in the midst of the seventieth week; and
by his death he caused the sacrifice and oblation
to cease.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Paul thus describes the abrogation of the typical
system at the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the
way, nailing it to his cross.... Let no man therefore
judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an
holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days;
which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is
of Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The object of this action is declared to be the
handwriting of ordinances. The manner of its
abrogation is thus stated: 1. Blotted out; 2.
Nailed to the cross; 3. Taken out of the way.
Its nature is shown in these words: “Against us”
and “contrary to us.” The things contained in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
it were meats, drinks, holy days [Gr. ἑορτης a feast
day], new moons and sabbaths.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The whole is
declared a shadow of good things to come; and
the body which casts this shadow is of Christ.
That law which was proclaimed by the voice of
God and written by his own finger upon the tables
of stone, and deposited beneath the mercy-seat,
was altogether unlike that system of carnal
ordinances that was written by Moses in a book,
and placed in the side of the ark.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> It would
be absurd to speak of the tables of <span class="smcap">stone</span>
as <span class="smcap">nailed</span> to the cross; or to speak of <span class="smcap">blotting</span>
out what was <span class="smcap">engraved</span> in <span class="smcap">stone</span>. It would be
blasphemous to represent the Son of God as pouring
out his blood to blot out what the finger of
his Father had written. It would be to confound
all the immutable principles of morality, to represent
the ten commandments as “contrary” to
man’s moral nature. It would be to make Christ
the minister of sin, to represent him as dying to
utterly destroy the moral law. Nor does that
man keep truth on his side who represents the
ten commandments as among the things contained
in Paul’s enumeration of what was abolished.
Nor is there any excuse for those who would destroy
the ten commandments with this statement
of Paul; for he shows, last of all, that what was
thus abrogated was a shadow of good things to
come—an absurdity if applied to the moral law.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
The feasts, new moons, and sabbaths, of the ceremonial
law, which Paul declared to be abolished
in consequence of the abrogation of that code,
have been particularly noticed already.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> That
the Sabbath of the Lord is not included in their
number, the following facts evince:—</p>

<p>1. The Sabbath of the Lord was made before
sin entered our world. It is not therefore one of
those things that shadow redemption from sin.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>2. Being made <span class="smcap">for</span> man before the fall it is
not one of those things that are <span class="smcap">against</span> him and
<span class="smcap">contrary</span> to him.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>3. When the ceremonial sabbaths were ordained
they were carefully distinguished from the
Sabbath of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>4. The Sabbath of the Lord does not owe its
existence to the handwriting of ordinances, but is
found in the very bosom of that law which Jesus
came not to destroy. The abrogation of the ceremonial
law could not therefore abolish the Sabbath
of the fourth commandment.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>5. The effort of our Lord through his whole
ministry to redeem the Sabbath from the thralldom
of the Jewish doctors, and to vindicate it as
a merciful institution, is utterly inconsistent with
the idea that he nailed it to his cross, as one of
those things against man and contrary to him.</p>

<p>6. Our Lord’s petition respecting the flight of
the disciples from Judea, recognizes the sacredness
of the Sabbath many years after the crucifixion
of the Saviour.</p>

<p>7. The perpetuity of the Sabbath in the new
earth is not easily reconciled with the idea that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
it was blotted out and nailed to our Lord’s cross
as one of those things that were contrary to
man.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>8. Because the authority of the fourth commandment
is expressly recognized after the Saviour’s
crucifixion.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>9. And finally, because the royal law which is
unabolished embodies the ten commandments,
and consequently embraces and enforces the Sabbath
of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>When the Saviour died upon the cross the
whole typical system which had pointed forward
to that event as the commencement of its antitype,
expired with him. The Saviour being
dead, Joseph of Arimathea went in unto Pilate
and begged the body of Jesus, and with the assistance
of Nicodemus, buried it in his own new
tomb.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath
drew on. And the women also, which came with him from
Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how
his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared
spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according
to the commandment. Now upon the first day of the
week, very early in the morning, they came unto the
sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared,
and certain others with them.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This text is worthy of special attention. 1.
Because it is an express recognition of the fourth
commandment after the crucifixion of the Lord
Jesus. 2. Because it is the most remarkable case
of Sabbatic observance in the whole Bible. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
Lord of the Sabbath was dead; preparation being
made for his embalming, when the Sabbath
drew on it was suspended, and they rested, says
the sacred historian, according to the commandment.
3. Because it shows that the Sabbath day
according to the commandment is the day before
the first day of the week; thus identifying the
seventh day in the commandment with the seventh
day of the New-Testament week. 4. Because
it is a direct testimony that the knowledge
of the true seventh day was preserved as late as
the crucifixion; for they observed the day enjoined
in the commandment; and that was the
day on which the Most High had rested from the
work of creation.</p>

<p>In the course of the day following this Sabbath,
that is, upon the first day of the week, it
was ascertained that Jesus was risen from the
dead. It appears that this event must have taken
place upon that day, though it is not thus stated
in express terms. At this point of time it is supposed
by many that the Sabbath was changed
from the seventh to the first day of the week;
and that the sacredness of the seventh day was
then transferred to the first day of the week,
which thenceforth was the Christian Sabbath,
enforced by all the authority of the fourth commandment.
To judge of the truthfulness of these
positions, let us read with care each mention of
the first day found in the four evangelists. Thus
writes Matthew:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward
the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene
and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus also Mark writes:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene
and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought
sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And
very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they
came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun....
Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week,
he appeared first to Mary Magdalene.”</p>

</div>

<p>Luke uses the following language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And they returned and prepared spices and ointments,
and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.
Now upon the first day of the week, very early
in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing
the spices which they had prepared, and certain others
with them.”</p>

</div>

<p>John bears the following testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene
early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher, and seeth
the stone taken away from the sepulcher.... Then
the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled
for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in
their midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In these texts the foundation of the “Christian
Sabbath” must be sought—if indeed such an institution
actually exists—for there are no other records
of the first day which relate to the time when
it is supposed to have become sacred. These
texts are supposed to prove that at the resurrection
of the Saviour, the first day absorbed the
sacredness of the seventh, elevating itself from
the rank of a secular to that of a sacred day, and
abasing the Sabbath of the Lord to the rank of
“the six working days.”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Yet the following facts
must be regarded as very extraordinary indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
if this supposed change of the Sabbath here took
place:—</p>

<p>1. That these texts should contain no mention
of this change of the Sabbath. 2. That they
should carefully discriminate between the Sabbath
of the fourth commandment and the first
day of the week. 3. That they should apply no
sacred title to that day; particularly that they
should omit the title of Christian Sabbath. 4.
That they should not mention the fact that
Christ rested upon that day; an act essential to
its becoming his Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> 5. That they do not
relate the act of taking the blessing of God from
the seventh day, and placing it upon the first;
and indeed that they do not mention any act
whatever of blessing and hallowing the day. 6.
That they omit to mention anything that Christ
did to the first day; and that they even neglect
to inform us that Christ so much as took up the
first day of the week into his lips! 7. That
they give no precept in support of first-day observance,
nor do they contain a hint of the manner
in which the first day of the week can be enforced
by the authority of the fourth commandment.</p>

<p>Should it be asserted, however, from the words
of John, that the disciples were on this occasion
convened for the purpose of honoring the day of
the resurrection, and that Jesus sanctioned this
act by meeting with them, thus accomplishing
the change of the Sabbath, it is sufficient to cite
in reply the words of Mark in which the same
interview is narrated:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at
meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness
of heart, because they believed not them which had
seen him after he was risen.”<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This testimony of Mark shows that the inference
so often drawn from the words of John is
utterly unfounded. 1. The disciples were assembled
for the purpose of eating supper. 2. Jesus
came into their midst and upbraided them for
their unbelief respecting his resurrection.</p>

<p>The Scriptures declare that “with God all
things are possible;” yet this statement is limited
by the declaration that God cannot lie.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Does
the change of the Sabbath pertain to those things
that are possible with God, or is it excluded by
that important limitation, <i>God cannot lie</i>? The
Law-giver is the God of truth, and his law is the
truth.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Whether it would still remain the truth
if changed to something else, and whether the
Law-giver would still continue to be the God of
truth after he had thus changed it, remains to be
seen. The fourth commandment, which is affirmed
to have been changed, is thus expressed:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy....
The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God....
For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and
hallowed it.”</p>

</div>

<p>If now we insert “first day” in place of the
seventh, we shall bring the matter to a test:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy....
The first day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all that in them is, and rested the first day, wherefore
the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”</p>

</div>

<p>This changes the truth of God into a lie;<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> for
it is false that God rested upon the first day of
the week and blessed and hallowed it. Nor is it
possible to change the rest-day of the Creator
from that day on which he rested to one of the
six days on which he did not rest.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> To change
a part of the commandment, and to leave the
rest unchanged, will not therefore answer, as the
truth which is left is still sufficient to expose the
falsehood which is inserted. A more radical
change is needed, like the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Remember the Christian Sabbath, to keep it holy.
The first day is the Sabbath of the Lord Jesus Christ.
For on that day he arose from the dead; wherefore he
blessed the first day of the week, and hallowed it.”</p>

</div>

<p>After such a change, no part of the original
Sabbatic institution remains. Not only is the
rest-day of the Lord left out, but even the reasons
on which the fourth commandment is based are
of necessity omitted also. But does such an edition
of the fourth commandment as this exist?
Not in the Bible, certainly. Is it true that such
titles as these are applied to the first day? Never,
in the Holy Scriptures. Did the Law-giver bless
and hallow that day? Most assuredly not. He
did not even take the name of it into his lips.
Such a change of the fourth commandment on
the part of the God of truth is impossible; for it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
not merely affirms that which is false and denies
that which is true, but it turns the truth of God
itself into a lie. It is simply the act of setting
up a rival to the Sabbath of the Lord, which,
having neither sacredness nor authority of its
own, has contrived to absorb that of the Bible
Sabbath itself. Such is the <span class="smcap">foundation</span> of the
first-day Sabbath. The texts which are employed
in rearing the institution upon this foundation
will be noticed in their proper order and place.
Several of these texts properly pertain to this
chapter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And after eight days again his disciples were within,
and Thomas with them; then came Jesus, the doors being
shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto
you.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is not asserted that on this occasion our Lord
hallowed the first day of the week; for that act
is affirmed to date from the resurrection itself on
the authority of the texts already quoted. But
the sacredness of the first day being assumed as
the foundation, this text furnishes the first stone
for the superstructure; the first pillar in the first-day
temple. The argument drawn from it may
be thus stated: Jesus selected this day as the one
in which to manifest himself to his disciples; and
by this act strongly attested his regard for the
day. But it is no small defect in this argument
that his next meeting with them was on a fishing
occasion,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and his last and most important manifestation,
when he ascended into Heaven, was
upon Thursday.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The act of the Saviour in meeting
with his disciples must therefore be yielded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
as insufficient of itself to show that any day is
sacred; for it would otherwise prove the sacredness
of several of the working days. But a still
more serious defect in this argument is found in
the fact that this meeting of Jesus with his disciples
does not appear to have been upon the first
day of the week. It was “after eight days” from
the previous meeting of Jesus and the disciples,
which, coming at the very close of the resurrection
day, could not but have extended into the
second day of the week.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> “After eight days”
from this meeting, if made to signify only one
week, necessarily carries us to the second day of
the week. But a different expression is used by
the Spirit of inspiration when simply one week
is intended. “After seven days” is the chosen
term of the Holy Spirit when designating just
one week.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> “After eight days” most naturally
implies the ninth or tenth day;<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> but allowing it
to mean the eighth day, it fails to prove that this
appearance of the Saviour was upon the first day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
of the week. To sum up the argument: The
first meeting of Jesus with his disciples in the
evening at the close of the first day of the week
was mainly if not wholly upon the second day
of the week;<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> the second meeting could not have
been earlier in the week than the second or third
day, and the day seems to have been selected
simply because that Thomas was present; the
third meeting was upon a fishing occasion; and
the fourth, was upon Thursday, when he ascended
into Heaven. The argument for first-day sacredness
drawn from this text is eminently fitted to
the foundation of that sacredness already examined;
and the institution of the first-day Sabbath
itself, unless formed of more substantial
frame-work than enters into its foundation, is at
best only a castle in the air.</p>

<p>The text which next enters into the fabric of
first-day sacredness is the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they
were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly
there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This text is supposed to contribute an important
pillar for the first-day temple. On this wise
it is furnished: The disciples were convened on
this occasion to celebrate the first-day Sabbath,
and the Holy Spirit was poured out at that time
in honor of that day. To this deduction there
are, however, the most serious objections. 1. That
there is no evidence that a first-day Sabbath was
then in existence. 2. That there is no intimation
that the disciples came together on this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
occasion for its celebration. 3. Nor that the
Holy Spirit was then poured out in honor of the
first day of the week. 4. That from the ascension
of Jesus until the day of the Spirit’s outpouring,
the disciples had continued in prayer
and supplication, so that their being convened on
this day was nothing materially different from
what had been the case for the past ten or more
days.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> 5. That had the sacred writer designed
to show that a certain day of the week was honored
by the events narrated, he would doubtless
have stated that fact, and named that day. 6.
That Luke was so far from naming the day of
the week that it is even now a disputed point;
eminent first-day authors<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> even asserting that
the day of Pentecost that year came upon the
<i>seventh</i> day. 7. That the one great event which
the Holy Spirit designed to mark was the antitype
of the feast of Pentecost; the day of the
week on which that should occur being wholly
immaterial. How widely, therefore, do those err
who reverse this order, making the day of the
week, which the Holy Spirit has not even named,
but which they assume to be the first day, the
thing of chief importance, and passing in silence
over that fact which the Holy Spirit has so carefully
noted, that this event took place upon the
day of Pentecost. The conclusion to which these
facts lead is inevitable; viz., that the pillar furnished
from this text for the first-day temple is
like the foundation of that edifice, simply a thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
of the imagination, and quite worthy of a place
beside the pillar furnished from the record of our
Lord’s second appearance to his disciples.</p>

<p>A third pillar for the first-day edifice is the
following: Redemption is greater than creation;
therefore the day of Christ’s resurrection should
be observed instead of the day of the Creator’s
rest. But this proposition is open to the fatal
objection that the Bible says nothing of the kind.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
Who then knows that it is true? When the
Creator gave existence to our world, did he not
foresee the fall of man? And, foreseeing that fall,
did he not entertain the purpose of redeeming
man? And does it not follow that the purpose
of redemption was entertained in that of creation?
Who then can affirm that redemption is
greater than creation?</p>

<p>But as the Scriptures do not decide this point,
let it be assumed that redemption is the greater.
Who knows that a day should be set apart for its
commemoration? The Bible says nothing on the
point. But granting that a day should be set
apart for this purpose, what day should have the
preference? Is it said, That day on which redemption
was finished? It is not true that redemption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
is finished; the resurrection of the
saints and the redemption of our earth from the
curse are included in that work.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> But granting
that redemption should be commemorated before
it is finished, by setting apart a day in its honor,
the question again arises, What day shall it be?
The Bible is silent in reply. If the most memorable
day in the history of redemption should be
selected, undoubtedly the day of the crucifixion,
on which the price of human redemption was paid,
must have the preference. Which is the more
memorable day, that on which the infinite Law-giver
gave up his only and well-beloved Son to
die an ignominious death for a race of rebels who
had broken his law, or that day on which he restored
that beloved Son to life? The latter event,
though of thrilling interest, is the most natural
thing in the world; the crucifixion of the Son of
God for sinful men may be safely pronounced the
most wonderful event in the annals of eternity.
The crucifixion day is therefore beyond all comparison
the more memorable day. And that redemption
itself is asserted of the crucifixion
rather than of the resurrection is an undoubted
fact. Thus it is written:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In whom we have redemption through his blood;”
“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
made a curse for us, for it is written, Cursed is every
one that hangeth on a tree;” “Thou wast slain, and
hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If, therefore, any day should be observed in
memory of redemption, unquestionably the day
of the crucifixion should have the preference.
But it is needless to pursue this point further.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Whether the day of the crucifixion or the day of
the resurrection should be preferred is quite immaterial.
The Holy Spirit has said nothing in
behalf of either of these days, but it has taken
care that the <i>event</i> in each case should have its
own appropriate memorial. Would you commemorate
the crucifixion of the Redeemer? You
need not change the Sabbath to the crucifixion
day. It would be a presumptuous sin in you to
do this. Here is the divinely appointed memorial
of the crucifixion:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed,
took bread; and when he had given thanks, he
brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is
broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After
the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my
blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance
of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this
cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is the death of the Redeemer, therefore, and
not the day of his death that the Holy Spirit has
thought worthy of commemoration. Would you
also commemorate the resurrection of the Redeemer?
You need not change the Sabbath of
the Bible for that purpose. The great Law-giver
has never authorized such an act. But an appropriate
memorial of that event has been ordained:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized
into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? Therefore
we are buried with him by baptism into death; that
like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of
the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of
life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his
resurrection.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To be buried in the watery grave as our Lord
was buried in the tomb, and to be raised from the
water to walk in newness of life, as our Lord was
raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
is the divinely authorized memorial of the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus. And let it be observed,
it is not the day of the resurrection, but
the resurrection itself, that was thought worthy
of commemoration. The events which lie at the
foundation of redemption are the death, burial,
and resurrection, of the Redeemer. Each of
these has its appropriate memorial; while the
days on which they severally occurred have no
importance attached to them. It was the death
of the Redeemer, and not the day of his death,
that was worthy of commemoration; and hence
the Lord’s supper was appointed for that purpose.
It was the resurrection of the Saviour, and not
the day of the resurrection, that was worthy of
commemoration; and hence burial in baptism
was ordained as its memorial. It is the change
of this memorial to sprinkling that has furnished
so plausible a plea for first-day observance in
memory of the resurrection.</p>

<p>To celebrate the work of redemption by resting
from labor on the first day of the week after six
days of toil, it should be true that our Lord accomplished
the work of human redemption in the
six days prior to that of his resurrection, and that
he rested on that day from the work, blessing it,
and setting it apart for that reason. Yet not one
of these particulars is true. Our Lord’s whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
life was devoted to this work. He rested temporarily
from it indeed over the Sabbath following
his crucifixion, but resumed the work on the
morning of the first day of the week, which he
has never since relinquished, and never will,
until its perfect accomplishment in the resurrection
of the saints and the redemption of the
purchased possession. Redemption, therefore,
furnishes no plea for a change of the Sabbath;
its own memorials being quite sufficient, without
destroying that of the great Creator. And thus
the third pillar in the temple of first-day sacredness,
like the other parts of that structure which
have been already examined, is found to be a
thing of the imagination only.</p>

<p>A fourth pillar in this temple is taken from an
ancient prophecy in which it is claimed that the
Christian Sabbath was foretold:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The stone which the builders refused is become the
head stone of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing; it is
marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord
hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This text is considered one of the strongest
testimonies in support of the Christian Sabbath.
Yet it is necessary to assume the very points
that this text is supposed to prove. 1. It is
assumed that the Saviour became the head of the
corner by his resurrection. 2. That the day of
his resurrection was made the Christian Sabbath
in commemoration of that event. 3. And that
this day thus ordained should be celebrated by
abstinence from labor, and attendance upon divine
worship.</p>

<p>To these extraordinary assumptions it is proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
to reply: 1. There is no proof that Jesus became
the head of the corner on the day of his resurrection.
The Scriptures do not mark the day when
this event took place. His being made head of
the corner has reference to his becoming the chief
corner stone of that spiritual temple composed of
his people; in other words, it has reference to his
becoming head of that living body, the saints of
the Most High. It does not appear that he assumed
this position until his ascension on high,
where he became the chief corner stone in Zion
above, elect and precious.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> And hence there is
no evidence that the first day of the week is even
referred to in this text. 2. Nor is there the
slightest evidence that that day or any other day
was set apart as the Christian Sabbath in memory
of Christ’s resurrection. 3. Nor can there
well be found a more extraordinary assumption
than that this text enjoins the Sabbatic observance
of the first day of the week!</p>

<p>This scripture has manifest reference to the
Saviour’s act of becoming the head of the New-Testament
church; and consequently it pertains
to the opening of the gospel dispensation. The
day in which the people of God rejoice, in view
of this relation to the Redeemer, can therefore be
understood of no one day of the week; for they
are commanded to “rejoice <span class="smcap">evermore</span>;”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> but of
the whole period of the gospel dispensation. Our
Lord uses the word day in the same manner when
he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and
he saw it, and was glad.”<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>To assert the existence of what is termed the
Christian Sabbath on the ground that this text is
the prediction of such an institution, is to furnish
a fourth pillar for the first-day temple quite as
substantial as those already tested.</p>

<p>The seventieth week of Daniel’s prophecy extends
three and a half years beyond the death of
the Redeemer, to the commencement of the great
work for the Gentiles. This period of seven years
through which we have been passing is the most
eventful period in the history of the Sabbath. It
embraces the whole history of the Lord of the
Sabbath as connected with that institution: His
miracles and teaching, by which it is affirmed
that he weakened its authority; his death, at
which many affirm that he abrogated it; and his
resurrection, at which a still larger number declare
that he changed it to the first day of the
week. We have had the most ample evidence,
however, that each of these positions is false; and
that the opening of the great work for the Gentiles
witnessed the Sabbath of the fourth commandment
neither weakened, abrogated, nor
changed.</p>

</div>

<p>We have now traced the Sabbath through the
period of its especial connection with the family
of Abraham. The termination of the seventy
weeks brings us to the call of the Gentiles, and to
their admission to equal privileges with the Hebrew
race. We have seen that with God there
was no injustice in conferring especial blessings
upon the Hebrews, and at the same time leaving
the Gentiles to their own chosen ways.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Twice
had he given the human family, as a whole, the
most ample means of grace that their age of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
world admitted, and each time did it result in the
almost total apostasy of mankind. Then God selected
as his heritage the family of Abraham, his
friend; and by means of that family preserved in
the earth the knowledge of his law, his Sabbath,
and himself, until the coming of the great Messiah.
During his ministry, the Messiah solemnly affirmed
the perpetuity of his Father’s law, enjoining
obedience, even to its least commandment;<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> at
his death he broke down that middle wall of
partition<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> by which the Hebrews had so long
been preserved a separate people in the earth;
and when about to ascend into Heaven commanded
his disciples to go into all the world and preach
the gospel to every creature; teaching them to
observe all things which he had commanded
them.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> With the expiration of the seventieth
week, the apostles enter upon the execution of
this great commission to the Gentiles.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Several
facts of deep interest should here be noticed:—</p>

<p>1. The new covenant or testament dates from
the death of the Redeemer. In accordance with
the prediction of Jeremiah, it began with the
Hebrews alone, and was confined exclusively to
them until the expiration of the seventieth week.
Then the Gentiles were admitted to a full participation
with the Hebrews in its blessings, being
no longer aliens and foreigners, but fellow-citizens
with the saints.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> God entered into covenant
this time with his people as individuals and not
as a nation. The promises of this covenant embrace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
two points of great interest: (1) That God
will put his law into the hearts of his people. (2)
That he will forgive their sins. These promises
being made six hundred years before the birth of
Christ, there can be no question relative to what
was meant by the law of God. It was the law
of God then in existence that should be put into
the heart of each new-covenant saint. The new
covenant, then, is based upon the perpetuity of
the law of God; it does not abrogate that law,
but takes away sin, the transgression of the law,
from the heart, and puts the law of God in its
place.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The perpetuity of each precept of the
moral law lies, therefore, at the very foundation
of the new covenant.</p>

<p>2. As the first covenant had a sanctuary, and
within that sanctuary an ark containing the law
of God in ten commandments,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> and had also a
priesthood to minister before that ark, to make
atonement for the sins of men,<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> even thus is it
with the new covenant. Instead of the tabernacle
erected by Moses as the pattern of the true, the
new covenant has the greater and more perfect
tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man—the
temple of God in Heaven.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> As the great
central point in the earthly sanctuary was the
ark containing that law which man had broken,
even thus it is with the heavenly sanctuary.
“The temple of God was opened in Heaven, and
there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
Our Lord Jesus Christ as a great High<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Priest presents his own blood before the ark of
God’s testament in the temple in Heaven. Respecting
this object before which he ministers, let
the following points be noted:—</p>

<p>1. The ark in the heavenly temple is not
empty; it contains the testament of God; and
hence it is the great center of the sanctuary
above, as the ark of God’s testament was the center
of the sanctuary on earth.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>2. The death of the Redeemer for the sins of
men, and his work as High Priest before the ark
in Heaven, have direct reference to the fact that
within that ark is the law which mankind have
broken.</p>

<p>3. As the atonement and priesthood of Christ
have reference to the law within that ark before
which he ministers, it follows that this law existed
and was transgressed before the Saviour
came down to die for men.</p>

<p>4. And hence, the law contained in the ark
above is not a law which originated in the New
Testament; for it necessarily existed long anterior
to it.</p>

<p>5. If, therefore, God has revealed this law to
mankind, that revelation must be sought in the
Old Testament. For while the New Testament
makes many references to that law which caused
the Saviour to lay down his life for sinful men,
and even quotes from it, it never publishes a second
edition, but cites us to the Old Testament
for the original code.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>6. It follows, therefore, that this law is revealed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
and that this revelation is to be found in the Old
Testament.</p>

<p>7. In that volume will be found, (1) The descent
of the Holy One upon Mount Sinai; (2)
The proclamation of his law in ten commandments;
(3) The ten commandments written by
the finger of God upon two tables of stone; (4)
These tables placed beneath the mercy-seat in the
ark of the earthly sanctuary.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>8. That this remarkable Old-Testament law
which was shut up in the ark of the earthly sanctuary
was identical with that in the ark in Heaven,
may be thus shown: (1) The mercy-seat which
was placed over the ten commandments was the
place from which pardon was expected, the great
central point in the work of atonement;<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> (2)
The law beneath the mercy-seat was that which
made the work of atonement necessary; (3)
There was no atonement that could take away
sins; it was only a shadowy or typical atonement;
(4) But there was actual sin, and hence
a real law which man had broken; (5) There
must therefore be an atonement that can take
away sins; and that real atonement must pertain
to that law which was broken, and respecting
which an atonement had been shadowed forth.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
(6) The ten commandments are thus set forth in
the Old Testament as that law which demanded
an atonement; while the fact is ever kept in view
that those sacrifices there provided could not
avail to take away sins.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> (7) But the death of
Jesus as the antitype of those sacrifices, was designed
to accomplish precisely what they shadowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
forth, but which they could not effect, viz.,
to make atonement for the transgression of that
law which was placed in the ark beneath the
mercy-seat.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>We are thus brought to the conclusion that the
law of God contained in the ark in Heaven is identical
with that law which was contained in the
ark upon earth; and that both are identical with
that law which the new covenant puts in the
heart of each believer.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The Old Testament,
therefore, gives us the law of God and pronounces
it perfect; it also provides a typical atonement,
but pronounces it inadequate to take away sins.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
Hence what was needed was not a new edition of
the law of God; for that which was given already
was perfect; but a real atonement to take away
the guilt of the transgressor. So the New Testament
responds precisely to this want, providing
a real atonement in the death and intercession of
the Redeemer, but giving no new edition of the
law of God,<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> though it fails not to cite us to the
perfect code given long before. But although
the New Testament does not give a new edition
of the law of God, it does show that the Christian
dispensation has the great original of that law in
the sanctuary in Heaven.</p>

<p>9. We have seen that the new covenant places
the law of God in the heart of each believer, and
that the original of that law is preserved in the
temple in Heaven. That all mankind are amenable
to the law of God, and that they ever have
been, is clearly shown by Paul’s epistle to the
Romans. In the first chapter, he traces the origin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
of idolatry to the willful apostasy of the Gentiles,
which took place soon after the flood. In
the second chapter, he shows that although God
gave them up to their own ways, and as a consequence
left them without his written law, yet they
were not left in utter darkness; for they had by
nature the work of the law written in their hearts;
and dim as was this light, their salvation would
be secured by living up to it, or their ruin accomplished
by sinning against it. In the third chapter,
he shows what advantage the family of Abraham
had in being taken as the heritage of God,
while all other nations were left to their own
ways. It was that the oracles of God, the written
law, was given them in addition to that work
of the law written in the heart, which they had
by nature in common with the Gentiles. He
then shows that they were no better than the
Gentiles, because that both classes were transgressors
of the law. This he proves by quotations
from the Old Testament. Then he shows
that the law of God has jurisdiction over all
mankind:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now we know that what things soever the law saith,
it saith to them who are under the law, that every mouth
may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before
God.”<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He then shows that the law cannot save the
guilty, but must condemn them, and that justly.
Next, he reveals the great fact that redemption
through the death of Jesus is the only means by
which God can justify those who seek pardon,
and at the same time remain just himself. And
finally he exclaims:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Do we then make void the law through faith? God
forbid; yea, we establish the law.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It follows, therefore, that the law of God is unabolished;
that the sentence of condemnation
which it pronounces upon the guilty is as extensive
as is the offer of pardon through the gospel;
that its work exists in the hearts of men by nature;
from which we may conclude that man in his
uprightness possessed it in perfection, as is further
proved by the fact that the new covenant,
after delivering men from the condemnation of
the law of God, puts that law perfectly into their
hearts. From all of which it follows that the
law of God is the great standard by which sin is
shown,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and hence the rule of life, by which all
mankind, both Jews and Gentiles, should walk.</p>

<p>That the church in the present dispensation is
really a continuation of the ancient Hebrew church,
is shown by the illustration of the good olive tree.
That ancient church was God’s olive tree, and that
olive tree has never been destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Because of
unbelief, <i>some</i> of its branches were broken off;
but the proclamation of the gospel to the Gentiles
does not create a new olive tree; it only grafts
into the good olive tree such of the Gentiles as
believe; giving them a place among the original
branches, that with them they may partake of its
root and fatness. This olive tree must date from
the call of Abraham after the apostasy of the
Gentiles; its trunk representing the patriarchs,
beginning with the father of the faithful;<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> its
branches, the Hebrew people. The ingrafting of
the wild olive into the place of those branches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
which were broken off, represents the admission
of the Gentiles to equal privileges with the Hebrews
after the expiration of the seventy weeks.
The Old-Testament church, the original olive tree,
was a kingdom of priests and an holy nation; the
New-Testament church, the olive tree after the
ingrafting of the Gentiles, is described in the same
terms.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>When God gave up the Gentiles to apostasy
before the call of Abraham, he confounded their
language, that they should not understand one
another, and thus scattered them abroad upon
the face of the earth. Standing over against
this is the gift of tongues on the day of Pentecost,
preparatory to the call of the Gentiles, and their
ingrafting into the good olive tree.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>We have followed the Sabbath to the call of the
Gentiles, and the opening events of the gospel
dispensation. We find the law of God, of which
the Sabbath is a part, to be that which made our
Lord’s death as an atoning sacrifice necessary;
and that the great original of that law is in the
ark above, before which our Lord ministers as high
priest; while a copy of that law is by the new
covenant written within the heart of each believer.
It is seen, therefore, that the law of God is more
intimately connected with the people of God since
the death of the Redeemer than before that event.</p>

<p>That the apostolic church did sacredly regard
the Sabbath, as well as all the other precepts of
the moral law, admits of no doubt. The fact is
proved, not merely because the early Christians
were not accused of its violation by their most
inveterate enemies; nor wholly by the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
they held sin to be the transgression of the law,
and that the law was the great standard by
which sin is shown, and that by which sin becomes
exceeding sinful.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> These points are certainly
very decisive evidence that the apostolic
church did keep the fourth commandment. The
testimony of James relative to the ten commandments,
that he who violates one of them becomes
guilty of all, is yet another strong evidence that
the primitive church did sacredly regard the
whole law of God.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> But besides these facts we
have a peculiar guaranty that the Sabbath of the
Lord was not forgotten by the apostolic church.
The prayer which our Lord taught his disciples,
that their flight from Judea should not be upon
the Sabbath was, as we have seen, designed to
impress its sacredness deeply upon their minds,
and could not but have secured that result.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> In
the history of the primitive church we have
several important references to the Sabbath.
The first of these is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But when they departed from Perga, they came to
Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the
Sabbath day, and sat down.”<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

</div>

<p>By invitation of the rulers of the synagogue,
Paul delivered an extended address, proving that
Jesus was the Christ. In the course of these remarks
he used the following language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers,
because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the
prophets which are read every Sabbath day, they have
fulfilled them in condemning him.”<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

</div>

<p>When Paul’s discourse was concluded, we
read:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue,
the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached
to them the next Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Now when the congregation
was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes
followed Paul and Barnabas: who speaking to them, persuaded
them to continue in the grace of God. And the
next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to
hear the word of God.”<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These texts show, 1. That by the term Sabbath
in the book of Acts is meant that day on
which the Jewish people assembled in the synagogue
to listen to the voices of the prophets. 2.
That as this discourse was fourteen years after
the resurrection of Christ, and the record of it by
Luke was some thirty years after that event, it
follows that the alleged change of the Sabbath
at the resurrection of Christ had not, even after
many years, come to the knowledge of either
Luke or Paul. 3. That here was a remarkable
opportunity to mention the change of the Sabbath,
had it been true that the Sabbath had
been changed in honor of Christ’s resurrection.
For when Paul was asked to preach the
same words the next Sabbath, he might have
answered that the following day was now the
proper day for divine worship. And Luke, in
placing this incident upon record, could not well
avoid the mention of this new day, had it been
true that another day had become the Sabbath of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
the Lord. 4. That as this second meeting pertained
almost wholly to Gentiles, it cannot be
said in this case that Paul preached upon the
Sabbath out of regard to the Jews. On the
contrary, the narrative strongly indicates Paul’s
regard for the Sabbath as the proper day for divine
worship. 5. Nor can it be denied that the
Sabbath was well understood by the Gentiles in
this city, and that they had some degree of regard
for it, a fact which will be corroborated by
other texts.</p>

<p>Several years after these things, the apostles
assembled at Jerusalem to consider the question
of circumcision.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> “Certain men which came
down from Judea,” finding the Gentiles uncircumcised,
had “taught the brethren, and said,
Except ye be circumcised after the manner of
Moses ye cannot be saved.” Had they found the
Gentiles neglecting the Sabbath; unquestionably
this would have first called out their rebuke. It
is indeed worthy of notice that no dispute at this
time existed in the church relative to the observance
of the Sabbath; for none was brought before
this apostolic assembly. Yet had it been true
that the change of the Sabbath was then advocated,
or that Paul had taught the Gentiles to
neglect the Sabbath, without doubt those who
brought up the question of circumcision would
have urged that of the Sabbath with even greater
earnestness. That the law of Moses, the observance
of which was under discussion in this assembly,
is not the ten commandments, is evident
from several decisive facts. 1. Because that
Peter calls the code under consideration a <i>yoke</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
which neither their fathers nor themselves were
able to bear. But James expressly calls that
royal law, which, on his own showing, embodies
the ten commandments, a law of liberty. 2. Because
that this assembly did decide against the
authority of the law of Moses; and yet James,
who was a member of this body, did some years
afterward solemnly enjoin obedience to the commandments,
affirming that he who violated one
was guilty of all.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> 3. Because the chief feature
in the law of Moses as here presented was circumcision.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
But circumcision was not in the ten
commandments; and were it true that the law of
Moses includes these commandments, circumcision
would not in that case be a chief feature of that
law. 4. Finally, because that the precepts still
declared obligatory are not properly either of the
ten commandments. These were, first, the prohibition
of meats offered to idols; second, of
blood; third, of things strangled; and fourth, of
fornication.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Each of these precepts may be
often found in the books of Moses,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and the first
and last ones come under the second and seventh
commandments respectively; but neither of these
cover but a part of that which is forbidden in
either commandment. It is evident, therefore,
that the authority of the ten commandments was
not under consideration in this assembly, and
that the decision of that assembly had no relation
to those precepts. For otherwise the apostles
released the Gentiles from all obligation to eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
of the ten commandments, and from the greater
prohibitions contained in the other two.</p>

<p>It is evident that those greatly err who represent
the Gentiles as released from the obligation
of the Sabbath by this assembly. The question
did not come before the apostles on this occasion;
a strong proof that the Gentiles had not been
taught to neglect the Sabbath, as they had to
omit circumcision, which was the occasion of its
being brought before the apostles at Jerusalem.
Yet the Sabbath was referred to in this very
assembly as an existing institution, and that, too,
in connection with the Gentile Christians. Thus
when James pronounced sentence upon the question,
he used the following language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them,
which from among the Gentiles are turned to God; but
that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions
of idols, and from fornication, and from things
strangled, and from blood. For Moses of old time hath
in every city them that preach him, being read in the
synagogues every Sabbath day.”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This last fact is given by James as a reason for
the course proposed toward the brethren among
the Gentiles. “For Moses of old time hath in
every city them that preach him, being read in
the synagogues every Sabbath day.” From this
it is apparent that the ancient custom of divine
worship upon the Sabbath was not only preserved
by the Jewish people and carried with them into
every city of the Gentiles, but that the Gentile
Christians did attend these meetings. Otherwise
the reason assigned by James would lose all its
force, as having no application to this case. That
they did attend them strongly attests the Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
as the day of divine worship with the Gentile
churches.</p>

<p>That the ancient Sabbath of the Lord had neither
been abrogated nor changed prior to this
meeting of the apostles, is strongly attested by
the nature of the dispute here adjusted. And the
close of their assembly beheld the Bible Sabbath
still sacredly enthroned within the citadel of the
fourth commandment. After this, in a vision of
the night, Paul was called to visit Macedonia. In
obedience to this call he came to Philippi, which
is the chief city of that part of Macedonia. Thus
Luke records the visit:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And we were in that city abiding certain days. And
on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down,
and spake unto the women which resorted thither. And
a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
city of Thyatira, which worshiped God, heard us; whose
heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things
which were spoken of Paul.”<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This does not appear to have been a gathering
of Jews, but of Gentiles, who, like Cornelius, were
worshipers of the true God. Thus it is seen that
the church of the Philippians originated with a
pious assembly of Sabbath-keeping Gentiles. And
it is likely that Lydia and those employed by her
in business, who were evidently observers of the
Sabbath, were the means of introducing the gospel
into their own city of Thyatira.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and
Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue
of the Jews. And Paul, as his manner was,<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
in unto them, and three Sabbath days reasoned with them
out of the Scriptures.... And some of them believed,
and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout
Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women
not a few.”<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was the origin of the Thessalonian church.
That it was an assembly of Sabbath-keepers at
its beginning admits of no doubt. For besides
the few Jews who received the gospel through
the labors of Paul, there was a great multitude
of devout Greeks; that is, of Gentiles who had
united themselves with the Jews in the worship
of God upon the Sabbath. We have a strong
proof of the fact that they continued to observe
the Sabbath after their reception of the gospel in
the following words of Paul addressed to them as
a church of Christ:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of
God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus.”<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The churches in Judea, as we have seen, were
observers of the Sabbath of the Lord. The first
Thessalonian converts, before they received the
gospel, were Sabbath-keepers, and when they
became a Christian church they adopted the
churches in Judea as their proper examples.
And this church was adopted as an example by
the churches of Macedonia and Achaia. In this
number were included the churches of Philippi
and of Corinth. Thus writes Paul:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having
received the word in much affliction, with joy of the
Holy Ghost; so that ye were ensamples to all that believe
in Macedonia and Achaia. For from you sounded out
the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
but also in every place your faith to Godward is spread
abroad.”<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After these things, Paul came to Corinth. Here,
he first found Aquila and Priscilla.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And because he was of the same craft, he abode with
them and wrought; for by their occupation they were tent-makers.
And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath,
and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.”<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At this place also Paul found Gentiles as well
as Jews in attendance upon the worship of God
on the Sabbath. The first members of the church
at Corinth were therefore observers of the Sabbath
at the time when they received the gospel;
and, as we have seen, they adopted as their pattern
the Sabbath-keeping church of Thessalonica,
who in turn patterned after the churches in Judea.</p>

<p>The first churches were founded in the land of
Judea. All their members had from childhood
been familiar with the law of God, and well understood
the precept, “Remember the Sabbath
day, to keep it holy.” Besides this precept, all
these churches had a peculiar memento of the Sabbath.
They knew from our Lord himself that
the time was coming when they must all suddenly
flee from that land. And in view of this
fact, they were to pray that the moment of their
sudden flight might not be upon the Sabbath; a
prayer which was designed, as we have seen, to
preserve the sacredness of the Sabbath. That
the churches in Judea were composed of Sabbath-keeping
members, admits therefore of no
doubt.</p>

<p>Of the churches founded outside the land of
Judea, whose origin is given in the book of Acts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
nearly all began with Jewish converts. These
were Sabbath-keepers when they received the
gospel. Among these, the Gentile converts were
engrafted. And it is worthy of notice that in a
large number of cases, those Gentiles are termed
“devout Greeks,” “religious proselytes,” persons
that “worshiped God,” that feared God and that
“prayed to God alway.”<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> These Gentiles, at the
time of their conversion to the gospel, were, as we
have seen, worshipers of God upon the Sabbath
with the Jewish people. When James had proposed
the kind of letter that should be addressed
by the apostles to the Gentile converts, he assigned
a reason for its adoption, the force of which
can now be appreciated: “For Moses,” said he,
“of old time hath in <span class="smcap">every city</span> them that preach
him, being read in the synagogue every Sabbath
day.” The Sabbatarian character of the apostolic
churches is thus clearly shown.</p>

<p>In a letter addressed to the Corinthians, about
five years after they had received the gospel, Paul
is supposed to contribute a fifth pillar to the first-day
temple. Thus he wrote them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I
have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do
ye. Upon the first day of the week, let every one of you
lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that
there be no gatherings when I come.”<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From this text it is argued in behalf of the
first-day Sabbath, 1. That this was a public collection.
2. That hence the first day of the week
was the day of public worship in the churches of
Corinth and Galatia. 3. And therefore that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Sabbath had been changed to that day. Thus
the change of the Sabbath is inferred from the
public assemblies for divine worship on the first
day at Corinth and Galatia; and the existence of
these assemblies on that day is inferred from the
words of Paul, “Upon the first day of the week,
let every one of you lay <i>by him</i> in store.”</p>

<p>What, then, do these words ordain? But one
answer can be returned: They ordain precisely
the <i>reverse</i> of a public collection. Each one
should lay by himself on each first day of the
week according as God had prospered him, that
when Paul should arrive, they might have their
bounty ready. Mr. J. W. Morton, late Presbyterian
missionary to Hayti, bears the following
testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The whole question turns upon the meaning of the
expression, ‘by him;’ and I marvel greatly how you can
imagine that it means ‘in the collection box of the congregation.’
Greenfield, in his Lexicon, translates the
Greek term, ‘<i>With one’s self, i. e., at home</i>.’ Two Latin
versions, the Vulgate and that of Castellio, render it,
‘<i>apud se</i>,’ with one’s self; at home. Three French
translations, those of Martin, Osterwald, and De Sacy,
‘<i>chez soi</i>,’ at his own house; at home. The German of
Luther, ‘<i>bei sich selbst</i>,’ by himself; at home. The Dutch,
‘<i>by hemselven</i>,’ same as the German. The Italian of
Diodati, ‘<i>appresso di se</i>,’ in his own presence; at home.
The Spanish of Felippe Scio, ‘<i>en su casa</i>,’ in his own
house. The Portuguese of Ferreira, ‘<i>para isso</i>,’ with himself.
The Swedish, ‘<i>nær sig self</i>,’ near himself.”<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Bloomfield thus comments on the original:
“παρ ἑαυτῶ, ‘by him.’ French, <i>chez lui</i>, ‘at
home.’”<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>The Douay Bible reads: “Let every one of you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
put apart with himself.” Mr. Sawyer thus translates:
“Let each one of you lay aside by himself.”
Theodore Beza’s Latin version has it: “<i>Apud se</i>,”
<i>i.e.</i>, at home. The Syriac reads thus: “Let every
one of you lay aside and preserve at home.”</p>

<p>It is true that an eminent first-day writer,
Justin Edwards, D. D., in a labored effort to prove
the change of the Sabbath, brings forward this
text to show that Sunday was the day of religious
worship with the early church. Thus he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This laying by in store was <span class="smcap">not</span> laying by <span class="smcap">at home</span>;
for that would not prevent gatherings when he should
come.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is his language as a theologian upon
whom has fallen the difficult task of proving the
change of the Sabbath by the authority of the
Scriptures. But in his Notes on the New Testament,
in which he feels at liberty to speak the
truth, he thus squarely contradicts his own
language already quoted. Thus he comments on
this text:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Lay by him in store; <span class="smcap">at home</span>. That there be no
gatherings; that their gifts might be ready when the
apostle should come.”<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus even Dr. Edwards confesses that the idea
of a public collection is not found in this scripture.
On the contrary, it appears that each individual,
in obedience to this precept, would, at the opening
of each new week, be found <span class="smcap">at home</span> laying aside
something for the cause of God, according as his
worldly affairs would warrant. The change of
the Sabbath, as proved by this text, rests wholly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
upon an idea which Dr. Edwards confesses is not
found in it. We have seen that the church at
Corinth was a Sabbath-keeping church. It is
evident that the change of the Sabbath could
never have been suggested to them by this text.</p>

<p>This is the only scripture in which Paul even
mentions the first day of the week. It was
written nearly thirty years after the alleged
change of the Sabbath. Yet Paul omits all titles
of sacredness, simply designating it as first day of
the week; a name to which it was entitled as
one of “the six working days.”<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> It is also worthy
of notice that this is the only precept in the Bible
in which the first day is even named; and that
this precept says nothing relative to the sacredness
of the day to which it pertains; even the
duty which it enjoins being more appropriate to
a secular than to a sacred day.</p>

<p>Soon after writing his first epistle to the Corinthians,
Paul visited Troas. In the record of
this visit occurs the last instance in which the
first day of the week is mentioned in the New
Testament:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of
unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five
days;<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> where we abode seven days. And upon the first
day of the week, when the disciples came together to
break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart
on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
they were gathered together. And there sat in a window
a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into
a deep sleep; and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk
down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and
was taken up dead. And Paul went down, and fell on
him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves;
for his life is in him. When he therefore was come up
again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a
long while, even till break of day, so he departed. And
they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
comforted. And we went before to ship, and sailed unto
Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so had he
appointed, minding himself to go afoot.”<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This scripture is supposed to furnish a sixth
pillar for the first-day temple. The argument
may be concisely stated thus: This testimony
shows that the first day of the week was appropriated
by the apostolic church to meetings for
the breaking of bread in honor of Christ’s resurrection
upon that day; from which it is reasonable
to conclude that this day had become the
Christian Sabbath.</p>

<p>If this proposition could be established as an undoubted
truth, the change of the Sabbath would
not follow as a necessary conclusion; it would
even then amount only to a plausible conjecture.
The following facts will aid us in judging of the
truthfulness of this argument for the change of
the Sabbath. 1. That this is the only instance
of a religious meeting upon the first day of the
week recorded in the New Testament. 2. That
no stress can be laid upon the expression, “<i>when</i>
the disciples came together,” as proving that
meetings for the purpose of breaking bread were
held on each first day of the week; for there is
nothing in the original answering to the word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
“<i>when</i>;” the whole phrase being translated from
three words, the perfect passive participle συνηγμένων,
“being assembled,” and τῶν μαθητῶν, “the disciples;”
the sacred writer simply stating the gathering
of the disciples on this occasion.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> 3. That
the ordinance of breaking bread was not appointed
to commemorate the resurrection of Christ,
but to keep in memory his death upon the cross.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
The act of breaking bread therefore upon the first
day of the week, is not a commemoration of
Christ’s resurrection. 4. That as the breaking of
bread commemorates our Lord’s crucifixion, and
was instituted on the evening with which the
crucifixion day began, on which occasion Jesus
himself and all the apostles were present,<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> it is
evident that the day of the crucifixion presents
greater claims to the celebration of this ordinance
than does the day of the resurrection. 5. But as
our Lord designated no day for this ordinance,
and as the apostolic church at Jerusalem are recorded
to have celebrated it daily,<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> it is evidently
presumption to argue the change of the Sabbath
from a single instance of its celebration upon the
first day of the week. 6. That this instance of
breaking bread upon first-day, was with evident
reference to the immediate and final departure of
Paul. 7. For it is a remarkable fact that this,
the only instance of a religious meeting on the
first day recorded in the New Testament, was a
night meeting. This is proved by the fact that
many lights were burning in that assembly, and
that Paul preached till midnight. 8. And from
this fact follows the important consequence that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
this first-day meeting was upon Saturday night.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
For the days of the week being reckoned from
evening to evening, and evening being at sunset,<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
it is seen that the first day of the week begins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
Saturday night at sunset, and ends at sunset on
Sunday. A night meeting, therefore, upon the
first day of the week could be only upon Saturday
night. 9. Paul therefore preached until
midnight of Saturday night—for the disciples
held a night meeting at the close of the Sabbath,
because he was to leave in the morning—then
being interrupted by the fall of the young man,
he went down and healed him, then went up and
attended to the breaking of bread; and at break
of day, on Sunday morning, he departed. 10.
Thus are we furnished with conclusive evidence
that Paul and his companions resumed their journey
toward Jerusalem on the morning of the first
day of the week; they taking ship to Assos, and
he being pleased to go on foot. This fact is an
incidental proof of Paul’s regard for the Sabbath,
in that he waited till it was past before resuming
his journey; and it is a positive proof that he
knew nothing of what in modern times is called
the Christian Sabbath. 11. This narrative was
written by Luke at least thirty years after the
alleged change of the Sabbath. It is worthy of
note that Luke omits all titles of sacredness,
simply designating the day in question as the
first day of the week. This is in admirable
keeping with the fact that in his gospel, when recording
the very event which is said to have
changed the Sabbath, he not only omits the
slightest hint of that fact, but designates the day
itself by its secular title of first day of the week,
and at the same time designates the previous day
as the Sabbath according to the commandment.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>The same year that Paul visited Troas, he
wrote as follows to the church at Rome:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to
doubtful disputations. For one believeth that he may
eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let
not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let
not him which eateth not judge him that eateth; for God
hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another
man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth.
Yea, he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him
stand. One man esteemeth one day above another: another
esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully
persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day,
regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not
the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that
eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks;
and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and
giveth God thanks.”<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These words have often been quoted to show
that the observance of the fourth commandment
is now a matter of indifference; each individual
being at liberty to act his pleasure in the matter.
So extraordinary a doctrine should be thoroughly
tested before being adopted. For as it pleased
God to ordain the Sabbath before the fall of man,
and to give it a place in his code of ten commandments,
thus making it a part of that law to which
the great atonement relates; and as the Lord Jesus,
during his ministry, spent much time in explaining
its merciful design, and took care to provide
against its desecration at the flight of his
people from the land of Judea, which was ten
years in the future when these words were written
by Paul; and as the fourth commandment
itself is expressly recognized after the crucifixion
of Christ; if, under these circumstances, we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
suppose it to be consistent with truth that the
Most High should abrogate the Sabbath, we certainly
should expect that abrogation to be stated
in explicit language. Yet neither the Sabbath
nor the fourth commandment are here named.
That they are not referred to in this language of
Paul, the following reasons will show:—</p>

<p>1. Such a view would make the observance of
one of the ten commandments a matter of indifference;
whereas James shows that to violate one
of them is to transgress the whole.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> 2. It directly
contradicts what Paul had previously written
in this epistle; for in treating of the law of
ten commandments, he styles it holy, spiritual,
just, and good; and states that sin—the transgression
of the law—by the commandment becomes
“<span class="smcap">exceeding sinful</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> 3. Because that
Paul in the same epistle affirms the perpetuity of
that law which caused our Lord to lay down his
life for sinful men;<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> which we have seen before
was the ten commandments. 4. Because that
Paul in this case not only did not name the Sabbath
and the fourth commandment, but certainly
was not treating of the moral law. 5. Because
that the topic under consideration which leads
him to speak as he does of the days in question
was that of eating all kinds of food, or of refraining
from certain things. 6. Because that the
fourth commandment did not stand associated
with precepts of such a kind, but with moral laws
exclusively.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> 7. Because that in the ceremonial
law, associated with the precepts concerning
meats, was a large number of festivals, entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
distinct from the Sabbath of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> 8. Because
that the church of Rome, which began
probably with those Jews that were present from
Rome on the day of Pentecost, had many Jewish
members in its communion, as may be gathered
from the epistle itself;<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> and would therefore be
deeply interested in the decision of this question
relative to the ceremonial law; the Jewish members
feeling conscientious in observing its distinctions,
the Gentile members feeling no such
scruples: hence the admirable counsel of Paul
exactly meeting the case of both classes. 9. Nor
can the expression, “every day,” be claimed as
decisive proof that the Sabbath of the Lord is
included. At the very time when the Sabbath
was formally committed to the Hebrews, just
such expressions were used, although only the
six working days were intended. Thus it was
said: “The people shall go out and gather a certain
rate <i>every</i> day;” and the narrative says, “They
gathered it <i>every</i> morning.” Yet when some of
them went out to gather on the Sabbath, God
says, “How long refuse ye to keep my commandments
and my laws?”<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The Sabbath being a
great truth, plainly stated and many times repeated,
it is manifest that Paul, in the expression,
“every day,” speaks of the six working days,
among which a distinction had existed precisely
coeval with that respecting meats; and that he
manifestly excepts that day which from the beginning
God had reserved unto himself. Just as
when Paul quotes and applies to Jesus the words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
of David, “All things are put under him,” he
adds: “It is manifest that he is excepted which
did put all things under him.”<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> 10. And lastly,
in the words of John, “I was in the Spirit on the
Lord’s day,”<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> written many years after this epistle
of Paul, we have an absolute proof that in the
gospel dispensation one day is still claimed by the
Most High as his own.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>About ten years after this epistle was written,
occurred the memorable flight of all the people of
God that were in the land of Judea. It was not
in the winter; for it occurred just after the feast
of tabernacles, some time in October. And it was
not upon the Sabbath; for Josephus, who speaks
of the sudden withdrawal of the Roman army
after it had, by encompassing the city, given the
very signal for flight which our Lord promised
his people, tells us that the Jews rushed out of
the city in pursuit of the retreating Romans,
which was at the very time when our Lord’s injunction
of instant flight became imperative upon
the disciples. The historian does not intimate
that the Jews thus pursued the Romans upon
the Sabbath, although he carefully notes the fact
that a few days previous to this event they did,
in their rage, utterly forget the Sabbath and rush<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
out to fight the Romans upon that day. These
providential circumstances in the flight of the disciples
being made dependent upon their asking
such interposition at the hand of God, it is evident
that the disciples did not forget the prayer
which the Saviour taught them relative to this
event; and that, as a consequence, the Sabbath of
the Lord was not forgotten by them. And thus
the Lord Jesus in his tender care for his people
and in his watchful care in behalf of the Sabbath,
showed that he was alike the Lord of his people
and the Lord of the Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>Twenty-six years after the destruction of Jerusalem,
the book of Revelation was committed to
the beloved disciple. It bears the following
deeply interesting date as to place and time:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I John, who also am your brother, and companion in
tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
Christ, was in <span class="smcap">the isle</span> that is called <span class="smcap">Patmos</span>, for the
word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. I
was in the Spirit on <span class="smcap">the Lord’s day</span>, and heard behind
me a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha
and Omega, the first and the last; and, What thou seest,
write in a book.”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This book is dated in the isle of Patmos, and
upon the Lord’s day. The place, the day, and
the individual, have each a real existence, and
not merely a symbolical or mystical one. Thus
John, almost at the close of the first century, and
long after those texts were written which are
now adduced to prove that no distinction in days
exists, shows that the Lord’s day has as real an
existence, as has the isle of Patmos, or as had
the beloved disciple himself.</p>

<p>What day, then, is intended by this designation?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Several answers have been returned to
this question. 1. It is the gospel dispensation.
2. It is the day of Judgment. 3. It is the first
day of the week. 4. It is the Sabbath of the
Lord. The first answer cannot be the true one;
for it not only renders the day a mystical term,
but it involves the absurdity of representing
John as writing to Christians sixty-five years
after the death of Christ, that the vision which
he had just had, was seen by him in the gospel
dispensation; as though it were possible for them
to be ignorant of the fact that if he had a vision
at all he must have it in the existing dispensation.</p>

<p>Nor can the second answer be admitted as the
truth. For while it is true that John might
have a vision <span class="smcap">concerning</span> the day of Judgment,
it is impossible that he should have a vision <span class="smcap">on</span>
that day when it was yet future. If it be no
more than an absurdity to represent John as
dating his vision in the isle of Patmos, on the
gospel dispensation, it becomes a positive untruth,
if he is made to say that he was in vision at Patmos
on the day of Judgment.</p>

<p>The third answer, that the Lord’s day is the
first day of the week, is now almost universally
received as the truth. The text under examination
is brought forward with an air of triumph
as completing the temple of first-day sacredness,
and proving beyond all doubt that that day is
indeed the Christian Sabbath. Yet as we have
examined this temple with peculiar carefulness,
we have discovered that the foundation on which
it rests is a thing of the imagination only; and
that the pillars by which it is supported exist
only in the minds of those who worship at its
shrine. It remains to be seen whether the dome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
which is supposed to be furnished by this text is
more real than the pillars on which it rests.</p>

<p>That the first day of the week has no claim to
the title of Lord’s day, the following facts will
show: 1. That, as this text does not define the
term Lord’s day, we must look elsewhere in the
Bible for the evidence that shows the first day to
be entitled to such a designation. 2. That Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and Paul, the other sacred
writers who mention the day, use no other designation
for it than first day of the week, a name to
which it was entitled as one of the six working
days. Yet three of these writers mention it at
the very time when it is said to have become the
Lord’s day; and two of them mention it also
some thirty years after that event. 3. That
while it is claimed that the Spirit of inspiration,
by simply leading John to use the term Lord’s
day, though he did in no wise connect the first
day of the week therewith, did design to fix this
as the proper title of the first day of the week, it
is a remarkable fact that after John returned
from the isle of Patmos he wrote his gospel;<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
in that gospel he twice mentioned the first day
of the week; yet in each of these instances where
it is certain that first-day is intended, no other
designation is used than plain first day of the
week. This is a most convincing proof that John
did not regard the first day of the week as entitled
to this name, or any other, expressive of
sacredness. 4. What still further decides the
point against the first day of the week is the fact
that neither the Father nor the Son have ever
claimed the first day in any higher sense than
they have each of the six days given to man for
labor. 5. And what completes the chain of
evidence against the claim of first day to this
title is the fact that the testimony adduced by
first-day advocates to prove that it has been
adopted by the Most High in place of that day
which he once claimed as his, having been examined,
is found to have no such meaning or intent.
In setting aside the third answer, also, as not
being in accordance with truth, the first day of
the week may be properly dismissed with it, as
having no claim to our regard as a scriptural
institution.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>That the Lord’s day is the Bible Sabbath, admits
of clear and certain proof. The argument
stands thus: When God gave to man six days of
the week for labor, he did expressly reserve unto
himself the seventh, on which he placed his
blessing in memory of his own act of resting
upon that day, and thenceforward, through the
Bible, has ever claimed it as his holy day. As he
has never put away this sacred day and chosen
another, the Sabbath of the Lord is still his holy
day. These facts may be traced in the following
scriptures. At the close of the Creator’s rest, it
is said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:
because that in it he had rested from all his work which
God created and made.”<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After the children of Israel had reached the
wilderness of Sin, Moses said to them on the
sixth day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the
Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In giving the ten commandments, the Law-giver
thus stated his claim to this day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God....
For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the
seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
day, and hallowed it.”<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He gives to man the six days on which himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
had labored; he reserves as his own that day
upon which he had rested from all his work.
About eight hundred years after this, God spoke
by Isaiah as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If thou turn away thy foot from <span class="smcap">the Sabbath</span>, from
doing thy pleasure on <span class="smcap">my holy day</span>, ... then shalt
thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee
to ride upon the high places of the earth.”<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This testimony is perfectly explicit; the Lord’s
day is the ancient Sabbath of the Bible. The
Lord Jesus puts forth the following claim:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, whether it be the Father or the Son
whose title is involved, the only day that can be
called “the Lord’s day” is the Sabbath of the
great Creator.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> And here, at the close of the
Bible history of the Sabbath, two facts of deep
interest are presented: 1. That John expressly
recognizes the existence of the Lord’s day at the
very close of the first century. 2. That it pleased
the Lord of the Sabbath to place a signal honor
upon his own day in that he selected it as the
one on which to give that revelation to John,
which himself alone had been worthy to receive
from the Father.</p>

</div>

<p>The book of Acts is an inspired history of the
church. During the period which is embraced
in its record, the apostles and their fellow-laborers
were upon the stage of action, and under their
watchcare the churches of Christ preserved, to a
great extent, their purity of life and doctrine.
These apostolic churches are thus set forth as the
proper examples for all coming time. This book
fitly connects the narratives of the four evangelists
with the apostolic epistles, and thus joins
together the whole New Testament. But when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
we leave the period embraced in this inspired
history, and the churches which were founded
and governed by inspired men, we enter upon
altogether different times. There is, unfortunately,
great truth in the severe language of
Gibbon:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The theologian may indulge the pleasing task of describing
religion as she descended from Heaven, arrayed
in her native purity. A more melancholy duty is imposed
on the historian. He must discover the inevitable mixture
of error and corruption, which she contracted in a
long residence upon earth, among a weak and degenerate
race of beings.”<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What says the book of Acts respecting the
time immediately following the labors of Paul?
In addressing the elders of the Ephesian church,
Paul said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous
wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
things, to draw away disciples after them.”<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It follows from this testimony that we are not
authorized to receive the teaching of any man
simply because he lived immediately after the
apostolic age, or even in the days of the apostles
themselves. Grievous wolves were to enter the
midst of the people of God, and of their own
selves were men to arise, speaking perverse
things. If it be asked how these are to be distinguished
from the true servants of God, this is
the proper answer: Those who spoke and acted
in accordance with the teachings of the apostles
were men of God; those who taught otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
were of that class who should speak perverse
things to draw away disciples after them.</p>

<p>What say the apostolic epistles relative to this
apostasy? To the Thessalonians, it is written:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day
shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and
that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in
the temple of God, showing himself that he is God....
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he
who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the
way. And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the
Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and
shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.”<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To Timothy, in like manner, it is said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.
For the time will come when they will not endure
sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap
to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they
shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be
turned unto fables.”<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These texts are most explicit in predicting a
great apostasy in the church, and in stating the
fact that that apostasy had already commenced.
The Romish church, the eldest in apostasy, prides
itself upon its apostolic character. In the language
of Paul to the Thessalonians, already
quoted, that great Antichristian body may indeed
find its claim to an origin in apostolic times
vindicated, but its apostolic character most emphatically
denied. And herein is found a striking
illustration of the fact that an evil thing is not
rendered good by the accidental circumstance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
its originating in the days of the apostles. Every
thing, at its commencement, is either right or
wrong. If right, it may be known by its agreement
with the divine standard. If wrong at its
origin, it can never cease to be such. Satan’s
great falsehood which involved our race in ruin
has not yet become the truth, although six thousand
years have elapsed since it was uttered.
Think of this, ye who worship at the shrine of
venerable error. When the fables of men obtained
the place of the truth of God, he was
thereby dishonored. How, then, can he accept
obedience to them as any part of that pure devotion
which he requires at our hands? They that
worship God must worship him in Spirit and in
truth. How many ages must pass over the fables
of men before they become changed into divine
truth? That these predictions of the New
Testament respecting the great apostasy in the
church were fully realized, the pages of ecclesiastical
history present ample proof. Mr. Dowling,
in his History of Romanism, bears the following
testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is scarcely anything which strikes the mind of
the careful student of ancient ecclesiastical history with
greater surprise than the comparatively early period at
which many of the corruptions of Christianity, which are
embodied in the Romish system, took their rise; yet it is
not to be supposed that when the first originators of many
of these unscriptural notions and practices planted those
germs of corruption, they anticipated or even imagined
they would ever grow into such a vast and hideous system
of superstition and error, as is that of popery....
Each of the great corruptions of the latter ages took its
rise in a manner which it would be harsh to say was deserving
of strong reprehension.... The worship
of images, the invocation of saints, and the superstition
of relics, were but expansions of the natural feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
veneration and affection cherished toward the memory of
those who had suffered and died for the truth.”<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Robinson, author of the “History of Baptism,”
bears the following testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Toward the latter end of the second century most of
the churches assumed a new form, the first simplicity disappeared;
and insensibly, as the old disciples retired to
their graves, their children along with new converts, both
Jews and Gentiles, came forward and new modeled the
cause.”<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The working of the mystery of iniquity in the
first centuries of the Christian church is thus described
by a recent writer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During these centuries the chief corruptions of popery
were either introduced in principle, or the seeds of them
so effectually sown as naturally to produce those baneful
fruits which appeared so plentifully at a later period. In
Justin Martyr’s time, within fifty years of the apostolic
age, the cup was mixed with water, and a portion of the
elements sent to the absent. The bread, which at first
was sent only to the sick, was, in the time of Tertullian
and Cyprian, carried home by the people and locked up
as a divine treasure for their private use. At this time,
too, the ordinance of the supper was given to infants of
the tenderest age, and was styled the sacrifice of the body
of Christ. The custom of praying for the dead, Tertullian
states, was common in the second century, and became
the universal practice of the following ages; so that it
came in the fourth century to be reckoned a kind of heresy
to deny the efficacy of it. By this time the invocation
of saints, the superstitious use of images, of the sign of
the cross, and of consecrated oil, were become established
practices, and pretended miracles were confidently adduced
in proof of their supposed efficacy. Thus did that
mystery of iniquity, which was already working in the
time of the apostles, speedily after their departure, spread
its corruptions among the professors of Christianity.”<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>Neander speaks thus of the early introduction
of image worship:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And yet, perhaps, religious images made their way
from domestic life into the churches, as early as the end
of the third century; and the walls of the churches were
painted in the same way.”<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The early apostasy of the professed church is
a fact which rests upon the authority of inspiration,
not less than upon that of ecclesiastical history.
“The mystery of iniquity,” said Paul,
“doth already work.” We are constrained to
marvel that so large a portion of the people of
God were <i>so soon</i> removed from the grace of God
unto another gospel.</p>

<p>What shall be said of those who go to this period
of church history, and even to later times,
to correct their Bibles? Paul said that men
would rise in the very midst of the elders of the
apostolic church, who would speak perverse
things, and that men would turn away their ears
from the truth, and would be turned unto fables.
Are the traditions of this period of sufficient importance
to make void God’s word? The learned
historian of the popes, Archibald Bower, uses the
following emphatic language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To avoid being imposed upon, we ought to treat tradition
as we do a notorious and known liar, to whom we
give no credit, unless what he says is confirmed to us by
some person of undoubted veracity.... False and
lying traditions are of an early date, and the greatest men
have, out of a pious credulity, suffered themselves to be
imposed upon by them.”<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Dowling bears a similar testimony:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘The Bible, I say, the Bible only, is the religion of
Protestants!’ Nor is it of any account in the estimation
of the genuine Protestant <i>how early</i> a doctrine originated,
if it is not found in the Bible. He learns from the New
Testament itself that there were errors in the time of the
apostles, and that their pens were frequently employed
in combating those errors. Hence, if a doctrine be propounded
for his acceptance, he asks, Is it to be found in
the inspired word? Was it taught by the Lord Jesus
Christ and his apostles?... More than this, we
will add, that though Cyprian, or Jerome, or Augustine,
or even the fathers of an earlier age, Tertullian, Ignatius,
or Irenæus, could be plainly shown to teach the unscriptural
doctrines and dogmas of Popery, which, however, is
by no means admitted, still the consistent Protestant
would simply ask, Is the doctrine to be found in the Bible?
Was it taught by Christ and his apostles?...
He who receives a single doctrine upon the mere authority
of tradition, let him be called by what name he will,
by so doing steps down from the Protestant rock, passes
over the line which separates Protestantism from Popery,
and can give no valid reason why he should not receive
all the earlier doctrines and ceremonies of Romanism
upon the same authority.”<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Cumming of London thus speaks of the
authority of the fathers of the early church:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some of these were distinguished for their genius,
some for their eloquence, a few for their piety, and too
many for their fanaticism and superstition. It is recorded
by Dr. Delahogue (who was Professor in the Roman Catholic
College of Maynooth), on the authority of Eusebius,
that the fathers who were really most fitted to be the luminaries
of the age in which they lived, were too busy in
preparing their flocks for martyrdom to commit anything
to writing; and, therefore, by the admission of this
Roman Catholic divine, we have not the full and fair exponent
of the views of all the fathers of the earlier centuries,
but only of those who were most ambitious of literary
distinction, and least attentive to their charges....
The most devoted and pious of the fathers were
busy teaching their flocks; the more vain and ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
occupied their time in preparing treatises. If all the
fathers who signalized the age had committed their sentiments
to writing, we might have had a fair representation
of the theology of the church of the fathers; but as only
a few have done so (many even of their writings being
mutilated or lost), and these not the most devoted and
spiritually minded, I contend that it is as unjust to judge
of the theology of the early centuries by the writings of
the few fathers who are its only surviving representatives,
as it would be to judge of the theology of the nineteenth
century by the sermons of Mr. Newman, the speeches of
Dr. Candlish, or the various productions of the late Edward
Irving.”<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Adam Clarke bears the following decisive
testimony on the same subject:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But of these we may safely state that there is not a
<i>truth</i> in the most orthodox creed that cannot be proved
by their authority; nor a <i>heresy</i> that has disgraced the
Romish church, that may not challenge them as its abettors.
In points of <i>doctrine</i>, their authority is, <i>with me</i>,
nothing. The <span class="smcap">word</span> of God alone contains my creed.
On a number of points I can go to the Greek and Latin
fathers of the church to know what <i>they believed</i>; and
what the people of their respective communions believed:
but after all this, I must return to God’s word to know
what he would have <i>me</i> to believe.”<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In his life, he uses the following strong language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We should take heed how we quote the fathers in
proof of the doctrines of the gospel; because he who
knows them best, knows that on many of those subjects
they blow hot and cold.”<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The following testimonies will in part explain
the unreliable nature of the fathers. Thus Ephraim
Pagitt testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The church of Rome having been conscious of their
errors and corruptions, both in faith and manners, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
sundry times, pretended reformations; yet their great
pride and infinite profit, arising from purgatory, pardons,
and such like, hath hindered all such reformations.
Therefore, to maintain their greatness, errors, and new
articles of faith, 1. They have corrupted many of the ancient
fathers, and reprinting them, make them speak as
they would have them.... 2. They have written
many books in the names of these ancient writers, and
forged many decrees, canons, and councils, to bear false
witness to them.”<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Wm. Reeves testifies to the same fact:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The church of Rome has had all the opportunities of
time, place, and power, to establish the kingdom of darkness;
and that in coining, clipping, and washing, the
primitive records to their own good liking, they have not
been wanting to themselves, is notoriously evident.”<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The traditions of the early church are considered
by many quite as reliable as the language
of the Holy Scriptures. A single instance taken
from the Bible will illustrate the character of
tradition, and show the amount of reliance that
can be placed upon it:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom
Jesus loved, following (which also leaned on his breast
at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth
thee?); Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what
shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that
he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou
me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren,
that that disciple should not die; yet Jesus said not unto
him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I
come, what is that to thee?”<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here is the account of a tradition which actually
originated in the very bosom of the apostolic
church, which nevertheless handed down to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
the following generations an entire mistake. Observe
how carefully the word of God corrects this
error.</p>

<p>Two rules of faith really embrace the whole
Christian world. One of these is the word of
God alone; the other is the word of God and the
traditions of the church. Here they are:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">I. THE RULE OF THE MAN OF GOD, THE BIBLE ALONE.</p>

<p>“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
in righteousness; that the man of God may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.”<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p class="center">II. THE RULE OF THE ROMANIST, THE BIBLE AND
TRADITION.</p>

<p>“If we would have the whole rule of Christian faith
and practice, we must not be content with those scriptures
which Timothy knew from his infancy, that is, with the
Old Testament alone; nor yet with the New Testament,
without taking along with it the traditions of the apostles,
and the interpretation of the church, to which the apostles
delivered both the book and the true meaning of it.”<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is certain that the first-day Sabbath cannot
be sustained by the first of these rules; for the
word of God says nothing respecting such an institution.
The second of these rules is necessarily
adopted by all those who advocate the sacredness
of the first day of the week. For the writings
of the fathers and the traditions of the
church furnish all the testimony which can be
adduced in support of that day. To adopt the
first rule is to condemn the first-day Sabbath
as a human institution. To adopt the second
is virtually to acknowledge that the Romanists
are right; for it is by this rule that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
are able to sustain their unscriptural dogmas.
Mr. W. B. Taylor, an able anti-Sabbatarian writer,
states this point with great clearness:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The triumph of the consistent Roman Catholic over
all observers of Sunday, calling themselves Protestants,
is indeed complete and unanswerable.... It should
present a subject of very grave reflection to Christians of
the reformed and evangelical denominations, to find that
no single argument or suggestion can be offered in favor of
Sunday observance, that will not apply with equal force
and to its fullest extent in sustaining the various other
‘holy days’ appointed by ‘the church.’”<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Listen to the argument of a Roman Catholic:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The word of God commandeth the seventh day to be
the Sabbath of our Lord, and to be kept holy: you
[Protestants] without any precept of Scripture, change it
to the first day of the week, only authorized by our traditions.
Divers English Puritans oppose against this
point, that the observation of the first day is proved out
of Scripture, where it is said ‘the first day of the week.’<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
Have they not spun a fair thread in quoting these places?
If we should produce no better for purgatory and prayers
for the dead, invocation of the saints, and the like, they
might have good cause indeed to laugh us to scorn; for
where is it written that these were Sabbath days in which
those meetings were kept? Or where is it ordained they
should be always observed? Or, which is the sum of all,
where is it decreed that the observation of the first day
should abrogate or abolish the sanctifying of the seventh
day, which God commanded everlastingly to be kept holy?
Not one of those is expressed in the written word
of God.”<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Whoever therefore enters the lists in behalf of
the first-day Sabbath, must of necessity do this—though
perhaps not aware of the fact—under
the banner of the church of Rome.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SUNDAY-LORD’S DAY NOT TRACEABLE TO THE APOSTLES.</span></h3>

<p>General statement respecting the Ante-Nicene fathers—The
change of the Sabbath never mentioned by one of these
fathers—Examination of the historical argument for Sunday
as the Lord’s day—This argument compared with
the like argument for the Catholic festival of the Passover.</p>

</div>

<p>The Ante-Nicene fathers<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> are those Christian
writers who flourished after the time of the apostles,
and before the Council of Nice, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 325.
Those who govern their lives by the volume of
Inspiration do not recognize any authority in
these fathers to change any precept of that book,
nor any authority in them to add any new precepts
to it. But those whose rule of life is the
Bible as modified by tradition, regard the early
fathers of the church as nearly or quite equal in
authority with the inspired writers. They declare
that the fathers conversed with the apostles;
or if they did not do this, they conversed
with some who had seen some of the apostles;
or at least they lived within a few generations of
the apostles, and so learned by tradition, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
involved only a few transitions from father to
son, what was the true doctrine of the apostles.</p>

<p>Thus with perfect assurance they supply the
lack of inspired testimony in behalf of the so-called
Christian Sabbath by plentiful quotations
from the early fathers. What if there be no mention
of the change of the Sabbath in the New
Testament? And what if there be no commandment
for resting from labor on the first day of
the week? Or, what if there be no method revealed
in the Bible by which the first day of the
week can be enforced by the fourth commandment?
They supply these serious omissions in
the Scriptures by testimonies which they say
were written by men who lived during the first
three hundred years after the apostles.</p>

<p>On such authority as this the multitude dare
to change the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.
But next to the deception under which
men fall when they are made to believe that the
Bible may be corrected by the fathers, is the deception
practiced upon them as to what the fathers
actually teach. It is asserted that the fathers
bear explicit testimony to the change of the
Sabbath by Christ as a historical fact, and that
they knew that this was so because they had
conversed with the apostles, or with some who
had conversed with them. It is also asserted
that the fathers called the first day of the week
the Christian Sabbath, and that they refrained
from labor on that day as an act of obedience to
the fourth commandment.</p>

<p>Now it is a most remarkable fact that every
one of these assertions is false. The people who
trust in the fathers as their authority for departing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
from God’s commandment are miserably deceived
as to what the fathers teach.</p>

<p>1. The fathers are so far from testifying that
the apostles told them Christ changed the Sabbath,
that not even one of them ever alludes to
the idea of such a change.</p>

<p>2. No one of them ever calls the first day the
Christian Sabbath, nor indeed ever calls it a Sabbath
of any kind.</p>

<p>3. They never represent it as a day on which
ordinary labor was sinful; nor do they represent
the observance of Sunday as an act of obedience
to the fourth commandment.</p>

<p>4. The modern doctrine of the change of the
Sabbath was therefore absolutely unknown in
the first centuries of the Christian church.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>But though no statement asserting the change
of the Sabbath can be produced from the writings
of the fathers of the first three hundred
years, it is claimed that their testimony furnishes
decisive proof that the first day of the week is
the Lord’s day of Rev. 1:10. The biblical argument
that the Lord’s day is the seventh day and
no other, because that day alone is in the Holy
Scriptures claimed by the Father and the Son
as belonging in a peculiar sense to each, is given
in chapter eleven, and is absolutely decisive. But
this is set aside without answer, and the claim of
the first day to this honorable distinction is substantiated
out of the fathers as follows:—</p>

<p>The term Lord’s day as a name for the first
day of the week can be traced back through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
first three centuries, from the fathers who lived
toward their close, to the ones next preceding who
mention the first day, and so backward by successive
steps till we come to one who lived in
John’s time, and was his disciple; and this disciple
of John calls the first day of the week the
Lord’s day. It follows therefore that John must
have intended the first day of the week by the
term Lord’s day, but did not define his meaning
because it was familiarly known by that name in
his time. Thus by history we prove the first day
of the week to be the Lord’s day of Rev. 1:10;
and then by Rev. 1:10, we prove the first day of
the week to be the sacred day of this dispensation;
for the spirit of inspiration by which John wrote
would not have called the first day by this name
if it were only a human institution, and if the
seventh day was still by divine appointment
the Lord’s holy day.</p>

<p>This is a concise statement of the strongest argument
for first-day sacredness which can be
drawn from ecclesiastical history. It is the argument
by which first-day writers prove Sunday to
be the day called by John the Lord’s day. This
argument rests upon the statement that Lord’s
day as a name for Sunday can be traced back to
the disciples of John, and that it is the name by
which that day was familiarly known in John’s
time.</p>

<p>But this entire statement is false. The truth
is, no writer of the first century, and no one of
the second, prior to <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 194, who is known to
speak of the first day of the week, ever calls it
the Lord’s day! Yet the first day is seven times
mentioned by the sacred writers <i>before</i> John’s
vision upon Patmos on the Lord’s day, and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
twice mentioned by John in his gospel which he
wrote <i>after</i> his return from that island, and is
mentioned some sixteen times by ecclesiastical
writers of the second century prior to <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 194,
and never in a single instance is it called the
Lord’s day! We give all the instances of its
mention in the Bible. Moses, in the beginning,
by divine inspiration, gave to the day its name,
and though the resurrection of Christ is said to
have made it the Lord’s day, yet every sacred
writer who mentions the day after that event
still adheres to the plain name of first day of the
week. Here are all the instances in which the
inspired writers mention the day:—</p>

<p>Moses, <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 1490. “The evening and the
morning were the first day.” Gen. 1:5.</p>

<p>Matthew, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 41. “In the end of the Sabbath,
as it began to dawn toward the first day of
the week.” Matt. 28:1.</p>

<p>Paul, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 57. “Upon the first day of the
week.” 1 Cor. 16:2.</p>

<p>Luke, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 60. “Now upon the first day of
the week.” Luke 24:1.</p>

<p>Luke, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 63. “And upon the first day of
the week.” Acts 20:7.</p>

<p>Mark, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 64. “And very early in the morning,
the first day of the week.” Mark 16:2.
“Now when Jesus was risen early the first day
of the week.” Verse 9.</p>

<p>After the resurrection of Christ, and before
John’s vision, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 96, the day is six times mentioned
by inspired men, and every time as plain
first day of the week. It certainly was not familiarly
known as Lord’s day before the time of
John’s vision. To speak the exact truth, it was
not called by that name at all, nor by any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
name equivalent to that, nor is there any record
of its being set apart by divine authority as such.</p>

<p>But in the year 96, John says, “I was in the
Spirit on the Lord’s day.” Rev. 1:10. Now it
is evident that this must be a day which the
Lord had set apart for himself, and which he
claimed as his. This was all true in the case
of the seventh day, but was not in any respect
true in that of the first day. He could not therefore
call the first day by this name, for it was not
such. But if the Spirit of God designed at this
point to create a new institution and to call a
certain day the Lord’s day which before had
never been claimed by him as such, it was necessary
that he should specify that new day. He
did not define the term, which proves that he
was not giving a sacred name to some new institution,
but was speaking of a well-known, divinely
appointed day. But <i>after</i> John’s return
from Patmos, he wrote his gospel,<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> and in that
gospel he twice had occasion to mention the first
day of the week. Let us see whether he adheres
to the manner of the other sacred writers, or
whether, when we know he means the first day,
he gives to it a sacred name.</p>

<p>John, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 97. “The first day of the week
cometh Mary Magdalene early.” John 20:1.
“Then the same day at evening, being the first
day of the week.” Verse 19.</p>

<p>These texts complete the Bible record of the
first day of the week. They furnish conclusive
evidence that John did not receive new light in
vision at Patmos, bidding him call the first day of
the week the Lord’s day, and when taken with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
all the instances preceding, they constitute a
complete demonstration that the first day was
not familiarly known as the Lord’s day in John’s
time, nor indeed known at all by that name then.
Let us now see whether Lord’s day as a title for
the first day can be traced back to John by
means of the writings of the fathers.</p>

<p>The following is a concise statement of the
testimony by which the fathers are made to
prove that John used the term Lord’s day as a
name for the first day of the week. A chain of
seven successive witnesses, commencing with one
who was the disciple of John, and extending forward
through several generations, is made to connect
and identify the Lord’s day of John with the
Sunday-Lord’s day of a later age. Thus, Ignatius,
the disciple of John, is made to speak familiarly of
the first day as the Lord’s day. This is directly connecting
the fathers and the apostles. Then the
epistle of Pliny, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 104, in connection with the
Acts of the Martyrs, is adduced to prove that the
martyrs in his time and forward were tested as
to their observance of Sunday, the question being,
“Have you kept the Lord’s day?” Next, Justin
Martyr, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140, is made to speak of Sunday
as the Lord’s day. After this, Theophilus of Antioch,
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 168, is brought forward to bear a powerful
testimony to the Sunday-Lord’s day. Then
Dionysius of Corinth, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 170, is made to speak
to the same effect. Next Melito of Sardis, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
177, is produced to confirm what the others have
said. And finally, Irenæus, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 178, who had
been the disciple of Polycarp, who had been the
disciple of John the apostle, is brought forward
to bear a decisive testimony in behalf of Sunday
as the Lord’s day and the Christian Sabbath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>These are the first seven witnesses who are
cited to prove Sunday the Lord’s day. They
bring us nearly to the close of the second century.
They constitute the chain of testimony by
which the Lord’s day of the apostle John is identified
with the Sunday-Lord’s day of later times.
First-day writers present these witnesses as proving
positively that Sunday is the Lord’s day of
the Scriptures, and the Christian church accepts
this testimony in the absence of that of the inspired
writers. But the folly of the people, and
the wickedness of those who lead them, may be
set forth in one sentence:—</p>

<p>The first, second, third, fourth, and seventh, of
these testimonies are inexcusable frauds, while
the fifth and sixth have no decisive bearing upon
the case.</p>

<p>1. Ignatius, the first of these witnesses, it is
said, must have known Sunday to be the Lord’s
day, for he calls it such, and he had conversed
with the apostle John. But in the entire writings
of this father the term Lord’s day does not
once occur, nor is there in them all a single mention
of the first day of the week! The reader
will find a critical examination of the epistles of
Ignatius in chapter fourteen of this history.</p>

<p>2. It is a pure fabrication that the martyrs in
Pliny’s time, about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 104, and thence onward,
were tested by the question whether they
had kept the Sunday-Lord’s day. No question
at all resembling this is to be found in the words
of the martyrs till we come to the fourth century,
and then the reference is not at all to the first
day of the week. This is fully shown in chapter
fifteen.</p>

<p>3. The Bible Dictionary of the American Tract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Society, page 379, brings forward the third of
these Sunday-Lord’s day witnesses in the person
of Justin Martyr, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140. It makes him call
Sunday the Lord’s day by quoting him as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Justin Martyr observes that ‘on the Lord’s day all
Christians in the city or country meet together, because
that is the day of our Lord’s resurrection.’”</p>

</div>

<p>But Justin never gave to Sunday the title of
Lord’s day, nor indeed any other sacred title.
Here are his words correctly quoted:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities
or in the country gather together to one place, and the
memoirs of the apostles, or the writings of the prophets,
are read, as long as time permits,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Justin speaks of the day called Sunday. But
that he may be made to help establish its title
to the name of Lord’s day, his words are deliberately
changed. Thus the third witness to Sunday
as the Lord’s day, like the first and the second,
is made such by fraud. But the fourth fraud
is even worse than the three which precede.</p>

<p>4. The fourth testimony to the Sunday-Lord’s
day is furnished in Dr. Justin Edwards’ Sabbath
Manual, p. 114:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Theophilus, bishop of Antioch, about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 162, says:
‘Both custom and reason challenge from us that we should
honor <i>the Lord’s day</i>, seeing on that day it was that our
Lord Jesus completed his resurrection from the dead.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Edwards does not pretend to give the place
in Theophilus where these words are to be found.
Having carefully and minutely examined every
paragraph of the writings of Theophilus several
times over, I state emphatically that nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the kind is to be found in that writer. He never
uses the term Lord’s day, and he does not even
speak of the first day of the week. These words
which are so well adapted to create the impression
that the Sunday-Lord’s day is of apostolic
institution, are put into his mouth by the falsehood
of some one.</p>

<p>Here are four frauds, constituting the first four
instances of the alleged use of Lord’s day as a
name for Sunday. Yet it is by means of these
very frauds that the Sunday-Lord’s day of later
ages is identified with the Lord’s day of the Bible.
Somebody invented these frauds. The use
to which they are put plainly indicates the purpose
for which they were framed. The title of
Lord’s day must be proved to pertain to Sunday
by apostolic authority. For this purpose these
frauds were a necessity. The case of the Sunday-Lord’s
day may be fitly illustrated by that of the
long line of popes. Their apostolic authority as
head of the Catholic church depends on their being
able to identify the apostle Peter as the first of
their line, and to prove that his authority was
transmitted to them. There is no difficulty in
tracing back their line to the early ages, though
the earliest Roman bishops were modest, unassuming
men, wholly unlike the popes of after
times. But when they come to make Peter the
head of their line, and to identify his authority
and theirs, they can do it only by fraudulent testimonials.
And such is the case with first-day
observance. It may be traced back as a festival
to the time of Justin Martyr, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140, but the
day had then no sacred name, and at that time
claimed no apostolic authority. But these must
be secured at any cost, and so its title of Lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
day is by a series of fraudulent testimonials
traced to the apostle John, as in like manner the
authority of the popes is traced to the apostle
Peter.</p>

<p>5. The fifth witness of this series is Dionysius
of Corinth, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 170. Unlike the four which
have been already examined, Dionysius actually
uses the term Lord’s day, though he says nothing
identifying it with the first day of the week.
His words are these:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To-day we have passed the Lord’s holy day, in which we
have read your epistle; in reading which we shall always
have our minds stored with admonition, as we shall, also,
from that written to us before by Clement.”<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The epistle of Dionysius to Soter, bishop of
Rome, from which this sentence is taken, has perished.
Eusebius, who wrote in the fourth century,
has preserved to us this sentence, but we
have no knowledge of its connection. First-day
writers quote Dionysius as the fifth of their witnesses
that Sunday is the Lord’s day. They say
that Sunday was so familiarly known as Lord’s
day in the time of Dionysius, that he calls it by
that name without even stopping to tell what
day he meant.</p>

<p>But it is not honest to present Dionysius as a
witness to the Sunday-Lord’s day, for he makes
no application of the term. But it is said he
certainly meant Sunday because that was the
familiar name of the day in his time, even as is
indicated by the fact that he did not define the
term. And how is it known that Lord’s day was
the familiar name of Sunday in the time of Dionysius?
The four witnesses already examined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
furnish all the evidence in proof of this, for there
is no writer this side of Dionysius who calls Sunday
the Lord’s day until almost the entire period
of a generation has elapsed. So Dionysius constitutes
the fifth witness of the series by virtue
of the fact that the first four witnesses prove that
in his time, Lord’s day was the common name
for first day of the week. But the first four testify
to nothing of the kind until the words are by
fraud put into their mouths! Dionysius is a witness
for the Sunday-Lord’s day because that four
fraudulent testimonials from the generations preceding
him fix this as the meaning of his words!
And the name Lord’s day must have been a very
common one for first day of the week because
Dionysius does not define the term! And yet
those who say this know that this <i>one</i> sentence
of his epistle remains, while the connection, which
doubtless fixed his meaning, has perished.</p>

<p>But Dionysius does not merely use the term
Lord’s day. He uses a stronger term than this—“the
Lord’s <i>holy</i> day.” Even for a long period
after Dionysius, no writer gives to Sunday so
sacred a title as “the Lord’s holy day.” Yet this
is the very title given to the Sabbath in the Holy
Scriptures, and it is a well-ascertained fact that
at this very time it was extensively observed,
especially in Greece, the country of Dionysius,
and that, too, as an act of obedience to the fourth
commandment.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>6. The sixth witness in this remarkable series
is Melito of Sardis, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 177. The first four, who
never use the term Lord’s day, are by direct
fraud made to call Sunday by that name; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
fifth, who speaks of the Lord’s holy day, is claimed
on the strength of these frauds to have meant by
it Sunday; while the sixth is not certainly proved
to have spoken of any day! Melito wrote several
books now lost, the titles of which have been
preserved to us by Eusebius.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> One of these, as
given in the English version of Eusebius, is “On
the Lord’s Day.” Of course, first-day writers
claim that this was a treatise concerning Sunday,
though down to this point no writer calls Sunday
by this name. But it is an important fact that
the word <i>day</i> formed no part of the title of
Melito’s book. It was a discourse on something pertaining
to the Lord—ὁ περι τῆς κυριακῆς λόγος—but the
essential word ἡμερας, <i>day</i>, is wanting. It may have
been a treatise on the life of Christ, for Ignatius
thus uses these words in connection: κυριακὴν ζωὴν,
<i>Lord’s life</i>. Like the sentence from Dionysius, it
would not even seem to help the claim of Sunday
to the title of Lord’s day were it not for the series
of frauds in which it stands.</p>

<p>7. The seventh witness summoned to prove
that Lord’s day was the apostolic title of Sunday,
is Irenæus. Dr. Justin Edwards professes to
quote him as follows:—<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hence Irenæus, bishop of Lyons, a disciple of Polycarp,
who had been the companion of the apostles, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
167 [it should be <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 178], says that the Lord’s day
was the Christian Sabbath. His words are, ‘On the
Lord’s day every one of us Christians keeps the Sabbath,
meditating on the law, and rejoicing in the works of
God.’”</p>

</div>

<p>This witness is brought forward in a manner to
give the utmost weight and authority to his words.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
He was the disciple of that eminent Christian martyr,
Polycarp, and Polycarp was the companion
of the apostles. What Irenæus says is therefore
in the estimation of many as worthy of our confidence
as though we could read it in the writings
of the apostles. Does not Irenæus call Sunday
the Christian Sabbath and the Lord’s day?
Did he not learn these things from Polycarp?
And did not Polycarp get them from the fountain
head? What need have we of further witness
that Lord’s day is the apostolic name for Sunday?
What if the six earlier witnesses have
failed us? Here is one that says all that can be
asked, and he had his doctrine from a man who
had his from the apostles!</p>

<p>Why then does not this establish the authority
of Sunday as the Lord’s day? The first reason
is that neither Irenæus nor any other man can
add to or change one precept of the word of God,
on any pretense whatever. We are never authorized
to depart from the words of the inspired
writers on the testimony of men who conversed
with the apostles, or rather who conversed with
some who had conversed with them. But the
second reason is that every word of this pretended
testimony of Irenæus is a fraud! Nor is there
a single instance in which the term Lord’s day
is to be found in any of his works, nor in any
fragment of his works preserved in other authors!<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
And this completes the seven witnesses by whom
the Lord’s day of the Catholic church is traced
back to and identified with the Lord’s day of
the Bible! It is not till <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 194, sixteen years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
after the latest of these witnesses, that we meet
the first instance in which Sunday is called the
Lord’s day. In other words, Sunday is not called
the Lord’s day till ninety-eight years after John
was upon Patmos, and one hundred and sixty-three
years after the resurrection of Christ!</p>

<p>But is not this owing to the fact that the records
of that period have perished? By no
means; for the day is six times mentioned by the
inspired writers between the resurrection of
Christ, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 31, and John’s vision upon Patmos,
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 96; namely, by Matthew, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 41; by Paul,
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 57; by Luke, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 60, and <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 63; and by
Mark, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 64; and always as first day of the
week. John, after his return from Patmos, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
97, twice mentions the day, still calling it first
day of the week.</p>

<p>After John’s time, the day is next mentioned
in the so-called epistle of Barnabas, written probably
as early as <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140, and is there called
“the eighth day.” Next it is mentioned by Justin
Martyr in his Apology, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140, once as “the
day on which we all hold our common assembly;”
once as “the first day on which God ... made
the world;” once as “the same day [on which
Christ] rose from the dead;” once as “the day
after that of Saturn;” and three times as “Sunday,”
or “the day of the sun.” Next the day is
mentioned by Justin Martyr in his Dialogue
with Trypho, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 155, in which he twice calls
it the “eighth day;” once “the first of all the
days;” once as “the first” “of all the days of the
[weekly] cycle;” and twice as “the first day after
the Sabbath.” Next it is once mentioned by
Irenæus, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 178, who calls it simply “the first
day of the week.” And next it is mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
once by Bardesanes, who calls it simply “the first
of the week.” The variety of names by which
the day is mentioned during this time is remarkable;
but it is <i>never</i> called Lord’s day,
nor ever called by <i>any sacred</i> name.</p>

<p>Though Sunday is mentioned in so many different
ways during the second century, it is not
till we come almost to the close of that century
that we find the first instance in which it is called
Lord’s day. Clement, of Alexandria, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 194,
uses this title with reference to “the eighth day.”
If he speaks of a natural day, he no doubt means
Sunday. It is not certain, however, that he
speaks of a natural day, for his explanation gives
to the term an entirely different sense. Here
are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the Lord’s day Plato prophetically speaks of in
the tenth book of the <i>Republic</i>, in these words: ‘And
when seven days have passed to each of them in the
meadow, on the eighth they are to set out and arrive
in four days.’ By the meadow is to be understood the
fixed sphere, as being a mild and genial spot, and the
locality of the pious; and by the seven days, each motion
of the seven planets, and the whole practical art which
speeds to the end of rest. But after the wandering orbs,
the journey leads to Heaven, that is, to the eighth motion
and day. And he says that souls are gone on the fourth
day, pointing out the passage through the four elements.
But the seventh day is recognized as sacred, not by the
Hebrews only, but also by the Greeks; according to which
the whole world of all animals and plants revolve.”<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Clement was originally a heathen philosopher,
and these strange mysticisms which he here puts
forth upon the words of Plato are only modifications
of his former heathen notions. Though
Clement says that Plato speaks of the Lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
day, it is certain that he does not understand
him to speak of literal days nor of a literal
meadow. On the contrary, he interprets the
meadow to represent “the fixed sphere, as being
a mild and genial spot, and the locality of the
pious;” which must refer to their future inheritance.
The seven days are not so many literal
days, but they represent “each motion of the
seven planets, and the whole practical art which
speeds to the end of rest.” This seems to represent
the present period of labor which is to
end in the rest of the saints. For he adds: “But
after the wandering orbs [represented by Plato’s
seven days] the journey leads to <i>Heaven</i>, that is,
to <i>the eighth</i> motion and <i>day</i>.” The seven days,
therefore, do here represent the period of the
Christian’s pilgrimage, and the eighth day of
which Clement here speaks is not Sunday, but
Heaven itself! Here is the first instance of
Lord’s day as a name for the eighth day, but this
eighth day is a mystical one, and means Heaven!</p>

<p>But Clement uses the term Lord’s day once
more, and this time clearly, as representing, not a
literal day, but the whole period of our regenerate
life. For he speaks of it in treating of fasting,
and he sets forth fasting as consisting in abstinence
from sinful pleasures, not only in deeds,
to use his distinction, as forbidden by the law, but
in thoughts, as forbidden by the gospel. Such
fasting pertains to the entire life of the Christian.
And thus Clement sets forth what is involved in
observing this duty in the gospel sense:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He, in fulfillment of the precept, according to the
gospel, keeps the Lord’s day, when he abandons an evil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
disposition, and assumes that of the Gnostic, glorifying
the Lord’s resurrection in himself.”<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From this statement we learn, not merely his
idea of fasting, but also that of celebrating the
Lord’s day, and glorifying the resurrection of
Christ. This, according to Clement, does not
consist in paying special honors to Sunday, but
in abandoning an evil disposition, and in assuming
that of the Gnostic, a Christian sect to which
he belonged. Now it is plain that this kind of
Lord’s-day observance pertains to no one day of
the week, but embraces the entire life of the
Christian. Clement’s Lord’s day was not a literal,
but a mystical, day, embracing, according to
this, his second use of the term, the entire regenerate
life of the Christian; and according to his
first use of the term, embracing also the future
life in Heaven. And this view is confirmed by
Clement’s statement of the contrast between the
Gnostic sect to which he belonged and other
Christians. He says of their worship that it was
“<span class="smcap">not on special days</span>, as some others, but <i>doing
this continually</i> in our whole life.” And he
speaks further of the worship of the Gnostic that
it was “<i>not</i> in a specified place, or selected temple,
or at certain festivals, and on appointed days,
<i>but during his whole life</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>It is certainly a very remarkable fact that the
first writer who speaks of the Lord’s day as the
eighth day uses the term, not with reference to a
literal, but a mystical, day. It is not Sunday,
but the Christian’s life, or Heaven itself! This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
doctrine of a perpetual Lord’s day, we shall find
alluded to in Tertullian, and expressly stated in
Origen, who are the next two writers that use
the term Lord’s day. But Clement’s mystical or
perpetual Lord’s day shows that he had no idea
that John, by Lord’s day, meant Sunday; for in
that case, he must have recognized that as the
true Lord’s day, and the Gnostics’ special day of
worship.</p>

<p>Tertullian, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 200, is the next writer who
uses the term Lord’s day. He defines his meaning,
and fixes the name upon the day of Christ’s
resurrection. Kitto<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> says this is “the earliest authentic
instance” in which the name is thus applied,
and we have proved this true by actual
examination of every writer, unless the reader
can discover some reference to Sunday in Clement’s
mystical eighth day. Tertullian’s words are
these:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We, however (just as we have received), only on the
Lord’s day of the resurrection [<i>solo die dominico resurrexionis</i>]
ought to guard, not only against kneeling, but every
posture and office of solicitude; deferring even our
business, lest we give any place to the devil. Similarly,
too, in the period of Pentecost; which period we distinguish
by the same solemnity of exultation.”<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Twice more does Tertullian use the term Lord’s
day, and once more does he define it, this time
calling it the “eighth day.” And in each of
these two cases does he place the day which he
calls Lord’s day in the same rank with the Catholic
festival of Pentecost, even as he does in the
instance already quoted. As the second instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
of Tertullian’s use of Lord’s day, we quote a portion
of the rebuke which he addressed to his
brethren for mingling with the heathen in their
festivals. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Oh! better fidelity of the nations to their own sects,
which claims no solemnity of the Christians for itself!
Not the Lord’s day, not Pentecost, <i>even if they had known
them</i>, would they have shared with us; for they would
fear lest they should seem to be Christians. <i>We</i> are not
apprehensive lest we seem to be <i>heathens</i>! If any indulgence
is to be granted to the flesh, you have it. I will
not say your own days, but more too; for to the <i>heathens</i>
each festive day occurs but once annually; <i>you</i> have a
festive day every eighth day.”<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The festival which Tertullian here represents
as coming every eighth day was no doubt the
one which he has just called the Lord’s day.
Though he elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> speaks of the Sunday festival
as observed at least by some portion of the
heathen, he here speaks of the Lord’s day as unknown
to those heathen of whom he now writes.
This strongly indicates that the Sunday festival
had but recently begun to be called by the name
of Lord’s day. But he once more speaks of the
Lord’s day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As often as the anniversary comes round, we make
offerings for the dead as birth-day honors. We count
fasting or kneeling in worship on the Lord’s day to be
unlawful. We rejoice in the same privilege also from
Easter to Whitsunday [the Pentecost]. We feel pained
should any wine or bread, even though our own, be cast
upon the ground. At every forward step and movement,
at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes
and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we
light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign
[of the cross].</p>

<p>“If, for these and other such rules, you insist upon
having positive Scripture injunction, you will find none.
Tradition will be held forth to you as the <i>originator</i> of
them, custom as their strengthener, and faith as their
observer. That reason will support tradition, and custom,
and faith, you will either yourself perceive, or learn
from some one who has.”<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This completes the instances in which Tertullian
uses the term Lord’s day, except a mere allusion
to it in his discourse on Fasting. It is
very remarkable that in each of the three cases,
he puts it on a level with the festival of Whitsunday,
or Pentecost. He also associates it directly
with “offerings for the dead” and with
the use of “the sign of the cross.” When asked
for authority from the Bible for these things, he
does not answer, “We have the authority of John
for the Lord’s day, though we have nothing but
tradition for the sign of the cross and offerings
for the dead.” On the contrary, he said there
was no Scripture injunction for any of them. If
it be asked, How could the title of Lord’s day be
given to Sunday except by tradition derived
from the apostles? the answer will be properly
returned, What was the origin of offerings for the
dead? And how did the sign of the cross come
into use among Christians? The title of Lord’s
day as a name for Sunday is no nearer apostolic
than is the sign of the cross, and offerings for the
dead; for it can be traced no nearer to apostolic
times than can these most palpable errors of the
great apostasy.</p>

<p>Clement taught a perpetual Lord’s day; Tertullian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
held a similar view, asserting that Christians
should celebrate a perpetual Sabbath, not
by abstinence from labor, but from sin.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Tertullian’s
method of Sunday observance will be noticed
hereafter.</p>

<p>Origen, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 231, is the third of the ancient
writers who call “the eighth day” the Lord’s day.
He was the disciple of Clement, the first writer
who makes this application. It is not strange,
therefore, that he should teach Clement’s doctrine
of a perpetual Lord’s day, nor that he should
state it even more distinctly than did Clement
himself. Origen, having represented Paul as
teaching that all days are alike, continues
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If it be objected to us on this subject that we ourselves
are accustomed to observe certain days, as for example
the Lord’s day, the Preparation, the Passover, or
Pentecost, I have to answer, that to the perfect Christian,
who is ever in his thoughts, words, and deeds, serving
his natural Lord, God the Word, all his days are the
Lord’s, and he is always keeping the Lord’s day.”<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This was written some forty years after Clement
had propounded his doctrine of the Lord’s
day. The imperfect Christian might honor a
Lord’s day which stood in the same rank with
the Preparation, the Passover, and the Pentecost.
But the perfect Christian observed the true Lord’s
day, which embraced all the days of his regenerate
life. Origen uses the term Lord’s day for
two different days. 1. For a natural day, which
in his judgment stood in the same rank with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Preparation day, the Passover, and the Pentecost.
2. For a mystical day, as did Clement, which is
the entire period of the Christian’s life. The
mystical day, in his estimation, was the true
Lord’s day. It therefore follows that he did not
believe Sunday to be the Lord’s day by apostolic
appointment. But, after Origen’s time, Lord’s
day becomes a common name for the so-called
eighth day. Yet these three men, Clement, Tertullian,
and Origen, who first make this application,
not only do not claim that this name was
given to the day by the apostles, but do plainly
indicate that they had no such idea. Offerings
for the dead and the use of the sign of the cross
are found as near to apostolic times as is the use
of Lord’s day as a name for Sunday. The three
have a common origin, as shown by Tertullian’s
own words. Origen’s views of the Sabbath, and
of the Sunday festival, will be noticed hereafter.</p>

<p>Such is the case with the claim of Sunday to
the title of Lord’s day. The first instance of its
use, if Clement be supposed to refer to Sunday,
is not till almost one century after John was in
vision upon Patmos. Those who first call it by
that name had no idea that it was such by divine
or apostolic appointment, as they plainly
show. In marked contrast with this is the
Catholic festival of the Passover. Though never
commanded in the New Testament, it can be
traced back to men who say that they had it
from the apostles!</p>

<p>Thus the churches of Asia Minor had the festival
from Polycarp who, as Eusebius states the
claim of Polycarp, had “observed it with John
the disciple of our Lord, and the rest of the apostles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
with whom he associated.”<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Socrates says
of them that they maintain that this observance
“was delivered to them by the apostle John.”<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
Anatolius says of these Asiatic Christians that
they received “the rule from an unimpeachable
authority, to wit, the evangelist John.”<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this all. The western churches also,
with the church of Rome at their head, were strenuous
observers of the Passover festival. They
also traced the festival to the apostles. Thus
Socrates says of them: “The Romans and those
in the western parts assure us that their usage
originated with the apostles Peter and Paul.”<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
But he says these parties cannot prove this by
written testimony. Sozomen says of the Romans,
with respect to the Passover festival, that they
“have never deviated from their original usage
in this particular; the custom having been
handed down to them by the holy apostles Peter
and Paul.”<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>If the Sunday-Lord’s day could be traced to a
man who claimed to have celebrated it with John
and other of the apostles, how confidently would
this be cited as proving positively that it is an
apostolic institution! And yet this can be done
in the case of the Passover festival! Nevertheless,
a single fact in the case of this very festival
is sufficient to teach us the folly of trusting in
tradition. Polycarp claimed that John and other
of the apostles taught him to observe the festival
on the fourteenth day of the first month, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
day of the week it might be; while the elders
of the Roman church asserted that Peter and
Paul taught them that it must be observed on
the Sunday following Good Friday!<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>The Lord’s day of the Catholic church can be
traced no nearer to John than <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 194, or perhaps
in strict truth to <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 200, and those who
then use the name show plainly that they did
not believe it to be the Lord’s day by apostolic
appointment. To hide these fatal facts by seeming
to trace the title back to Ignatius the disciple
of John, and thus to identify Sunday with the
Lord’s day of that apostle, a series of remarkable
frauds has been committed which we have had
occasion to examine. But even could the Sunday-Lord’s
day be traced to Ignatius, the disciple
of John, it would then come no nearer being an
apostolic institution than does the Catholic festival
of the Passover, which can be traced to Polycarp,
another of John’s disciples, who claimed to
have received it from John himself!</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FIRST WITNESSES FOR SUNDAY.</span></h3>

<p>Origin of Sunday observance the subject of present inquiry—Contradictory
statements of Mosheim and Neander—The
question between them stated, and the true data for deciding
that question—The New Testament furnishes no support
for Mosheim’s statement—Epistle of Barnabas a
forgery—The testimony of Pliny determines nothing in
the case—The epistle of Ignatius probably spurious, and
certainly interpolated so far as it is made to sustain Sunday—Decision
of the question.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>


<p>The first day of the week is now almost universally
observed as the Christian Sabbath. The
origin of this institution is still before us as the
subject of inquiry. This is presented by two
eminent church historians; but so directly do
they contradict each other, that it is a question
of curious interest to determine which of them
states the truth. Thus Mosheim writes respecting
the first century:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All Christians were unanimous in setting apart the
first day of the week, on which the triumphant Saviour
arose from the dead, for the solemn celebration of public
worship. This pious custom, which was derived from
the example of the church of Jerusalem, was founded upon
the express appointment of the apostles, who consecrated
that day to the same sacred purpose, and was observed
universally throughout the Christian churches, as appears
from the united testimonies of the most credible writers.”<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Now let us read what Neander, the most distinguished
of church historians, says of this
apostolic authority for Sunday observance:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was
always only a human ordinance, and it was far from the
intentions of the apostles to establish a divine command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
in this respect, far from them, and from the early apostolic
church, to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday.
Perhaps at the end of the second century a false
application of this kind had begun to take place; for men
appear by that time to have considered laboring on Sunday
as a sin.”<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

</div>

<p>How shall we determine which of these historians
is in the right? Neither of them lived in
the apostolic age of the church. Mosheim was
a writer of the eighteenth century, and Neander,
of the nineteenth. Of necessity therefore they
must learn the facts in the case from the writings
of that period which have come down to us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
These contain all the testimony which can have
any claim to be admitted in deciding this case.
These are, first, the inspired writings of the New
Testament; second, the reputed productions of
such writers of that age as are supposed to mention
the first day, viz., the epistle of Barnabas;
the letter of Pliny, governor of Bythinia, to the
emperor Trajan; and the epistle of Ignatius.
These are all the writings prior to the middle of
the second century—and this is late enough to
amply cover the ground of Mosheim’s statement—which
can be introduced as even referring to the
first day of the week.</p>

<p>The questions to be decided by this testimony
are these: Did the apostles set apart Sunday for
divine worship (as Mosheim affirms)? or does
the evidence in the case show that the festival
of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always
only a human ordinance (as is affirmed by Neander)?</p>

<p>It is certain that the New Testament contains
no appointment of Sunday for the solemn celebration
of public worship. And it is equally true
that there is no example of the church of Jerusalem
on which to found such observance. The
New Testament therefore furnishes no support<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
for the statement of Mosheim.</p>

<p>The three epistles which have come down to
us purporting to have been written in the apostolic
age, or immediately subsequent to that age,
next come under examination. These are all that
remain to us of a period more extended than that
embraced in the statement of Mosheim. He
speaks of the first century only; but we summon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
all the writers of that century, and of the following
one prior to the time of Justin Martyr, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
140, who are even supposed to mention the first
day of the week. Thus the reader is furnished
with all the data in the case. The epistle of Barnabas
speaks as follows in behalf of first-day observance:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Lastly he saith unto them, Your new-moons and your
sabbaths I cannot bear them. Consider what he means
by it; the sabbaths, says he, which ye now keep, are not
acceptable unto me, but those which I have made; when
resting from all things, I shall begin the eighth day, that
is, the beginning of the other world; for which cause we
observe the eighth day with gladness, in which Jesus
arose from the dead, and having manifested himself to
his disciples, ascended into Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It might be reasonably concluded that Mosheim
would place great reliance upon this testimony
as coming from an apostle, and as being
somewhat better suited to sustain the sacredness
of Sunday than anything previously examined
by us. Yet he frankly acknowledges that this
epistle is spurious. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The epistle of Barnabas was the production of some
Jew, who, most probably, lived in this century, and whose
mean abilities and superstitious attachment to Jewish fables,
show, notwithstanding the uprightness of his intentions,
that he must have been a very different person
from the true Barnabas, who was St. Paul’s companion.”<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In another work, Mosheim says of this epistle:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to what is suggested by some, of its having been
written by that Barnabas who was the friend and companion
of St. Paul, the futility of such a notion is easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
to be made apparent from the letter itself; several of the
opinions and interpretations of Scripture which it contains,
having in them so little of either truth, dignity or
force, as to render it impossible that they could ever have
proceeded from the pen of a man divinely instructed.”<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Neander speaks thus of this epistle:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is impossible that we should acknowledge this epistle
to belong to that Barnabas who was worthy to be the
companion of the apostolic labors of St. Paul.”<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Prof. Stuart bears a similar testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That a man by the name of Barnabas wrote this epistle
I doubt not; that the chosen associate of Paul wrote
it, I with many others must doubt.”<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Killen, Professor of Ecclesiastical History,
to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian
church of Ireland, uses the following language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The tract known as the Epistle of Barnabas was probably
composed in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 135. It is the production apparently
of a convert from Judaism who took special pleasure
in allegorical interpretation of Scripture.”<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Prof. Hackett bears the following testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The letter still extant, which was known as that of
Barnabas even in the second century, cannot be defended
as genuine.”<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Milner speaks of the reputed epistle of
Barnabas as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a great injury to him to apprehend the epistle,
which goes by his name, to be his.”<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Kitto speaks of this production as,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The so-called epistle of Barnabas, probably a forgery of
the second century.”<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Says the Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,
speaking of the Barnabas of the New Testament:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He could not be the author of a work so full of
forced allegories, extravagant and unwarrantable explications
of Scripture, together with stories concerning
beasts, and such like conceits, as make up the first part
of this epistle.”<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Eusebius, the earliest of church historians,
places this epistle in the catalogue of spurious
books. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Among the spurious must be numbered both the
books called, ‘The Acts of Paul,’ and that called, ‘Pastor,’
and ‘The Revelation of Peter.’ Besides these the
books called ‘The Epistle of Barnabas,’ and what are
called, ‘The Institutions of the Apostles.’”<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir Wm. Domville speaks as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the epistle was not written by Barnabas; it was
not merely unworthy of him,—it would be a disgrace to
him, and what is of much more consequence, it would be
a disgrace to the Christian religion, as being the production
of one of the authorized teachers of that religion in
the times of the apostles, which circumstance would seriously
damage the evidence of its divine origin. Not
being the epistle of Barnabas, the document is, as regards
the Sabbath question, nothing more than the testimony
of some unknown writer to the practice of Sunday observance
by some Christians of some unknown community,
at some uncertain period of the Christian era, with no
sufficient ground for believing that period to have been
the first century.”<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>Coleman bears the following testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The epistle of Barnabas, bearing the honored name
of the companion of Paul in his missionary labors, is evidently
spurious. It abounds in fabulous narratives, mystic,
allegorical interpretations of the Old Testament, and
fanciful conceits, and is generally agreed by the learned
to be of no authority.”<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As a specimen of the unreasonable and absurd
things contained in this epistle, the following passage
is quoted:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Neither shalt thou eat of the hyena: that is, again,
be not an adulterer; nor a corrupter of others; neither
be like to such. And wherefore so? Because that creature
every year changes its kind, and is sometimes male,
and sometimes female.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus first-day historians being allowed to decide
the case, we are authorized to treat this epistle
as a forgery. And whoever will read its ninth
chapter—for it will not bear quoting—will acknowledge
the justice of this conclusion. This
epistle is the only writing purporting to come
from the first century except the New Testament,
in which the first day is even referred to. That
this furnishes no support for Sunday observance,
even Mosheim acknowledges.</p>

<p>The next document that claims our attention
is the letter of Pliny, the Roman governor of
Bythinia, to the emperor Trajan. It was written
about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 104. He says of the Christians of
his province:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They affirmed that the whole of their guilt or error
was, that they met on a certain stated day, before it was
light, and addressed themselves in a form of prayer to
Christ, as to some god, binding themselves by a solemn
oath, not for the purposes of any wicked design, but never
to commit any fraud, theft, or adultery; never to falsify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called
upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to
separate, and then re-assemble to eat in common a harmless
meal.”<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This epistle of Pliny certainly furnishes no support
for Sunday observance. The case is presented
in a candid manner by Coleman. He says
of this extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This statement is evidence that these Christians kept
a day as holy time, but whether it was the last or the first
day of the week, does not appear.”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Charles Buck, an eminent first-day writer, saw
no evidence in this epistle of first-day observance,
as is manifest from the indefinite translation
which he gives it. Thus he cites the epistle:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These persons declare that their whole crime, if they
are guilty, consists in this: that on certain days they assemble
before sunrise to sing alternately the praises of
Christ as of God.”<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian, who wrote <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 200, speaks of this
very statement of Pliny thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He found in their religious services nothing but meetings
<i>at early morning</i> for singing hymns to Christ and
God, and sealing home their way of life by a united pledge
to be faithful to their religion, forbidding murder, adultery,
dishonesty, and other crimes.”<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian certainly found in this no reference
to the festival of Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. W. B. Taylor speaks of this stated day as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the Sabbath day appears to have been quite as
commonly observed at this date as the sun’s day (if not
even more so), it is just as probable that this ‘stated day’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
referred to by Pliny was the seventh day, as that it was
the first day; though the latter is generally <i>taken for
granted</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Taking for granted the very point that should
be proved, is no new feature in the evidence thus
far examined in support of first-day observance.
Although Mosheim relies on this expression
of Pliny as a chief support of Sunday, yet
he speaks thus of the opinion of another learned
man:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“B. Just. Hen. Boehmer, would indeed have us to understand
this day to have been the same with the Jewish
Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This testimony of Pliny was written a few
years subsequent to the time of the apostles. It
relates to a church which probably had been
founded by the apostle Peter.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> It is certainly
far more probable that this church, only forty
years after the death of Peter, was keeping the
fourth commandment, than that it was observing
a day never enjoined by divine authority. It
must be conceded that this testimony from Pliny
proves nothing in support of Sunday observance;
for it does not designate what day of the week
was thus observed.</p>

<p>The epistles of Ignatius of Antioch so often
quoted in behalf of first-day observance, next
claim our attention. He is represented as saying:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Wherefore if they who are brought up in these ancient
laws came nevertheless to the newness of hope; no
longer observing sabbaths, but keeping the Lord’s day,
in which also our life is sprung up by him, and through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
his death, whom yet some deny (by which mystery we
have been brought to believe, and therefore wait that we
may be found the disciples of Jesus Christ, our only master):
how shall we be able to live different from him;
whose disciples the very prophets themselves being, did
by the Spirit expect him as their master.”<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Two important facts relative to this quotation
are worthy of particular notice: 1. That the
epistles of Ignatius are acknowledged to be spurious
by first-day writers of high authority; and
those epistles which some of them except as possibly
genuine, do not include in their number the
epistle to the Magnesians from which the above
quotation is made, nor do they say anything relative
to first-day observance. 2. That the epistle
to the Magnesians would say nothing of any
day, were it not that the word day had been
fraudulently inserted by the translator! In support
of the first of these propositions the following
testimony is adduced. Dr. Killen speaks as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the sixteenth century, fifteen letters were brought
out from beneath the mantle of a hoary antiquity, and
offered to the world as the productions of the pastor of
Antioch. Scholars refused to receive them on the terms
required, and forthwith eight of them were admitted to
be forgeries. In the seventeenth century, the seven remaining
letters, in a somewhat altered form, again came
forth from obscurity, and claimed to be the works of Ignatius.
Again discerning critics refused to acknowledge
their pretensions; but curiosity was roused by this second
apparition, and many expressed an earnest desire to
obtain a sight of the real epistles. Greece, Syria, Palestine,
and Egypt, were ransacked in search of them, and
at length three letters are found. The discovery creates
general gratulation; it is confessed that four of the epistles
so lately asserted to be genuine, are apocryphal; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
it is boldly said that the three now forthcoming are above
challenge. But truth still refuses to be compromised, and
sternly disowns these claimants for her approbation. The
internal evidence of these three epistles abundantly attests
that, like the last three books of the Sibyl, they are
only the last shifts of a grave imposture.”<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same writer thus states the opinion of
Calvin:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is no mean proof of the sagacity of the great Calvin,
that, upwards of three hundred years ago, he passed
a sweeping sentence of condemnation on these Ignatian
epistles.”<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of the three epistles of Ignatius still claimed
as genuine, Prof. C. F. Hudson speaks as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ignatius of Antioch was martyred probably <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 115.
Of the eight epistles ascribed to him, three are genuine;
viz., those addressed to Polycarp, the Ephesians, and the
Romans.”<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed that the three epistles which
are here mentioned as genuine do not include that
epistle from which the quotation in behalf of
Sunday is taken, and it is a fact also that they
contain no allusion to Sunday. Sir Wm. Domville,
an anti-Sabbatarian writer, uses the following
language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every one at all conversant with such matters is
aware that the works of Ignatius have been more interpolated
and corrupted than those of any other of the ancient
fathers; and also that some writings have been attributed
to him which are wholly spurious.”<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Robinson, an eminent English Baptist writer
of the last century, expresses the following opinion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
of the epistles ascribed to Ignatius, Barnabas,
and others:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any of the writings attributed to those who are
called apostolical fathers, as Ignatius, teacher at Antioch,
Polycarp, at Smyrna, Barnabas, who was half a Jew, and
Hermas, who was brother to Pius, teacher at Rome, if
any of these be genuine, of which there is great reason to
doubt, they only prove the piety and illiteracy of the
good men. Some are worse, and the best not better, than
the godly epistles of the lower sort of Baptists and Quakers
in the time of the civil war in England. Barnabas
and Hermas both mention baptism; but both of these
books are contemptible reveries of wild and irregular geniuses.”<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The doubtful character of these Ignatian epistles
is thus sufficiently attested. The quotation
in behalf of Sunday is not taken from one of the
three epistles that are still claimed as genuine;
and what is still further to be observed, it would
say nothing in behalf of any day were it not for
an extraordinary license, not to say fraud, which
the translator has used in inserting the word <i>day</i>.
This fact is shown with critical accuracy by Kitto,
whose Cyclopedia is in high repute among
first-day scholars. Thus he presents the original
of Ignatius with comments and a translation as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We must here notice one other passage ... as bearing
on the subject of the Lord’s day, though it certainly
contains no mention of it. It occurs in the epistle of Ignatius
to the Magnesians (about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 100.) The whole
passage is confessedly obscure, and the text may be corrupt....
The passage is as follows:—</p>

<p>Εἰ οὖν ὁι ἐν πἀλαιοῖς πράγμασιν ἀναστραφέντες, εἰς καινότητα
ἐλπίδος ἤλθον—μηκέτι σαββατίζοντες, ἀλλὰ κατὰ κυριακὴν ζωὴν
ζῶντες—(ἐν ἡ καὶ ἡ ζωὴ ἡμῶν ἀνέτειλεν δὶ’ ἀυτοῦ, etc.)<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>“Now many commentators assume (on what ground
does not appear), that after κυριακὴν [Lord’s] the word
ἡμέραν [day] is to be understood.... Let us now look
at the passage simply as it stands. The defect of the sentence
is the want of a substantive to which ἀυτοῦ can refer.
This defect, so far from being remedied, is rendered
still more glaring by the introduction of ἡμέρα. Now
if we take κυριακὴ ζωὴ as simply ‘the life of the Lord,’
having a more personal meaning, it certainly goes nearer
to supplying the substantive to ἀυτοῦ.... Thus upon
the whole the meaning might be given thus:—</p>

<p>“If those who lived under the old dispensation have
come to the newness of hope, no longer keeping sabbaths,
but living according to our Lord’s life (in which, as it
were, our life has risen again through him, &amp;c.)....</p>

<p>“On this view the passage does not refer at all to the
Lord’s day; but even on the opposite supposition it cannot
be regarded as affording any positive evidence to the
early use of the term ‘Lord’s day’ (for which it is often
cited), since the material word ἡμέρα [day] is purely conjectural.”<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The learned Morer, a clergyman of the church
of England, confirms this statement of Kitto.
He renders Ignatius thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If therefore they who were well versed in the works of
ancient days came to newness of hope, not sabbatizing,
but living according to the dominical life, &amp;c....
The Medicean copy, the best and most like that of Eusebius,
leaves no scruple, because ζωὴν is expressed and determines
the word dominical to the person of Christ, and
not to the day of his resurrection.”<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir Wm. Domville speaks on this point as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Judging therefore by the tenor of the epistle itself,
the literal translation of the passage in discussion, ‘no
longer observing sabbaths, but living according to the
Lord’s life,’ appears to give its true and proper meaning;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
and if this be so, Ignatius, whom Mr. Gurney<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> puts forward
as a material witness to prove the observance of the
Lord’s day in the beginning of the second century, fails
to prove any such fact, it appearing on a thorough examination
of his testimony that he does not even mention
the Lord’s day, nor in any way allude to the religious observance
of it, whether by that name or by any other.”<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is manifest, therefore, that this famous quotation
has no reference whatever to the first day
of the week, and that it furnishes no evidence
that that day was known in the time of Ignatius
by the title of Lord’s day.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> The evidence is now
before the reader which must determine whether
Mosheim or Neander spoke in accordance with
the facts in the case. And thus it appears that
in the New Testament, and in the uninspired
writers of the period referred to, there is absolutely
nothing to sustain the strong Sunday
statement of Mosheim. When we come to the
fourth century, we shall find a statement by him
which essentially modifies what he has here said.
Of the epistles ascribed to Barnabas, Pliny, and
Ignatius, we have found that the first is a forgery;
that the second speaks of a stated day
without defining what one; and that the third,
which is probably a spurious document, would
say nothing relative to Sunday, if the advocates
of first-day sacredness had not interpolated the
word <i>day</i> into the document! We can hardly
avoid the conclusion that Mosheim spoke on this
subject as a doctor of divinity, and not as a historian;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
and with the firmest conviction that we
speak the truth, we say with Neander, “The festival
of Sunday was always only a human ordinance.”</p>

<span class="smaller">EXAMINATION OF A FAMOUS FALSEHOOD.</span></h3>

<p>Were the martyrs in Pliny’s time and afterward tested by
the question whether they had kept Sunday or not?—Argument
in the affirmative quoted from Edwards—Its origin—No
facts to sustain such an argument prior to the fourth
century—A single instance at the opening of that century
all that can be claimed in support of the assertion—Sunday
not even alluded to in that instance—Testimony of
Mosheim relative to the work in which this is found.</p>

</div>

<p>Certain doctors of divinity have made a special
effort to show that the “stated day” of Pliny’s
epistle is the first day of the week. For this purpose
they adduce a fabulous narrative which the
more reliable historians of the church have not
deemed worthy of record. The argument is this:
That in Pliny’s time and afterward, that is, from
the close of the first century and onward, whenever
the Christians were brought before their
persecutors for examination, they were asked
whether they had kept the Lord’s day, this term
being used to designate the first day of the week.
And hence two facts are asserted to be established:
1. That when Pliny says that the Christians
who were examined by him were accustomed
to meet on a stated day, that day was undoubtedly
the first day of the week. 2. That
the observance of the first day of the week was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the grand test by which Christians were known
to their heathen persecutors. 3. That Lord’s
day was the name by which the first day of the
week was known in the time of Pliny, a few
years after the death of John. To prove these
points, Dr. Edwards makes the following statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hence the fact that their persecutors, when they
wished to know whether men were Christians, were accustomed
to put to them this question, viz., ‘<i>Dominicum
servasti?</i>’—‘Hast thou kept the Lord’s day?’ If they had
they were Christians. This was the badge of their Christianity,
in distinction from Jews and pagans. And if
they said they had, and would not recant, they must be
put to death. And what, when they continued steadfast,
was their answer? ‘<i>Christianus sum; intermittere non possum</i>;’—‘I
am a Christian; I cannot omit it.’ It is a
badge of my religion, and the man who assumes it must
of course keep the Lord’s day, because it is the will of his
Lord; and should he abandon it, he would be an apostate
from his religion.”<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Gurney, an English first-day writer of
some note, uses the same argument and for the
same purpose.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The importance attached to this
statement, and the prominence given to it by the
advocates of first-day sacredness, render it proper
that its merits should be examined. Dr. Edwards
gives no authority for his statement; but Mr.
Gurney traces the story to Dr. Andrews, bishop
of Winchester, who claimed to have taken it from
the <i>Acta Martyrum</i>, an ancient collection of the
acts of the martyrs. It was in the early part of
the seventeenth century that Bishop Andrews
first brought this forward in his speech in the
court of Star Chamber, against Thraske, who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
accused before that arbitrary tribunal of maintaining
the heretical opinion that Christians are
bound to keep the seventh day as the Sabbath
of the Lord. The story was first produced, therefore,
for the purpose of confounding an observer
of the Sabbath when on trial by his enemies for
keeping that day. Sir Wm. Domville, an able
anti-Sabbatarian writer, thus traces out the matter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The bishop, as we have seen, refers to the <i>Acta</i> of
the martyrs as justifying his assertion respecting the
question, <i>Dominicum servasti?</i> but he does not cite a single
instance from them in which that question was put. We
are left therefore to hunt out the instances for ourselves,
wherever, if anywhere, they are to be found. The most
complete collection of the memoirs and legends still extant,
relative to the lives and sufferings of the Christian
martyrs, is that by Ruinart, entitled, ‘<i>Acta primorum
Martyrum sincera et selecta</i>.’ I have carefully consulted
that work, and I take upon myself to affirm that among
the questions there stated to have been put to the martyrs
in and before the time of Pliny, and for nearly two
hundred years afterwards, the question, <i>Dominicum servasti?</i>
does not once occur; nor any equivalent question.”<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This shows at once that no proof can be obtained
from this quarter, either that the “stated
day” of Pliny was the first day of the week, or
that the martyrs of the early church were tested
by the question whether they had observed it or
not. It also shows the statement to be false that
the martyrs of Pliny’s time called Sunday the
Lord’s day and kept it as such. After quoting
all the questions put to martyrs in and before
Pliny’s time, and thus proving that no such question
as is alleged, was put to them, Domville
says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This much may suffice to show that <i>Dominicum servasti?</i>
was no question in Pliny’s time, as Mr. Gurney intends
us to believe it was. I have, however, still other
proof of Mr. Gurney’s unfair dealing with the subject,
but I defer stating it for the present, that I may proceed
in the inquiry, What may have been the authority on
which Bishop Andrews relied when stating that <i>Dominicum
servasti?</i> was ever a usual question put by the heathen
persecutors? I shall with this view pass over the
martyrdoms which intervened between Pliny’s time and
the fourth century, as they contain nothing to the purpose,
and shall come at once to that martyrdom the narrative
of which was, I have no doubt, the source from
which Bishop Andrews derived his question, <i>Dominicum
servasti?</i> ‘Hold you the Lord’s day?’ This martyrdom
happened <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 304.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The sufferers were Saturninus and
his four sons, and several other persons. They were
taken to Carthage, and brought before the proconsul Amulinus.
In the account given of their examinations by
him, the phrases, ‘<span class="smcap">Celebrare</span> <i>Dominicum</i>,’ and ‘<span class="smcap">Agere</span>
<i>Dominicum</i>,’ frequently occur, but in no instance is the
verb ‘<i>servare</i>’ used in reference to <i>Dominicum</i>. I mention
this chiefly to show that when Bishop Andrews, alluding,
as no doubt he does, to the narrative of this martyrdom,
says the question was, <i>Dominicum servasti?</i> it is
very clear he had not his author at hand, and that in
trusting to his memory, he coined a phrase of his own.”<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Domville quotes at length the conversation between
the proconsul and the martyrs, which is
quite similar in most respects to Gurney’s and
Edward’s quotation from Andrews. He then
adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The narrative of the martyrdom of Saturninus being
the only one which has the appearance of supporting the
assertion of Bishop Andrews that, ‘Hold you the Lord’s
day?’ was the usual question to the martyrs, what if I
should prove that even this narrative affords no support
to that assertion? yet nothing is more easy than this
proof; for Bishop Andrews has quite mistaken the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
of the word <i>Dominicum</i> in translating it ‘the Lord’s
day.’ It had no such meaning. It was a barbarous word
in use among some of the ecclesiastical writers in, and
subsequent to, the fourth century, to express sometimes
a church, and at other times the Lord’s supper, but <span class="smcap">never</span>
the Lord’s day.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> My authorities on this point are—</p>

<p>“1. Ruinart, who, upon the word <i>Dominicum</i>, in the
narrative of the martyrdom of Saturninus, has a note, in
which he says it is a word signifying the Lord’s supper<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
(‘<i>Dominicum vero desinat sacra mysteria</i>’), and he quotes
Tertullian and Cyprian in support of this interpretation.</p>

<p>“2. The editors of the Benedictine edition of St. Augustine’s
works. They state that the word <i>Dominicum</i>
has the two meanings of a church and the Lord’s supper.
For the former they quote among other authorities, a
canon of the council of Neo Cesarea. For the latter
meaning they quote Cyprian, and refer also to St. Augustine’s
account of his conference with the Donatists, in
which allusion is made to the narrative of the martyrdom
of Saturninus.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“3. Gesner, who, in his Latin Thesaurus published in
1749, gives both meanings to the word <i>Dominicum</i>. For
that of the Lord’s supper he quotes Cyprian; for that of
a church he quotes Cyprian and also Hillary.”<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Domville states other facts of interest bearing
on this point, and then pays his respects to Mr.
Gurney as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It thus appearing that the reference made by Bishop
Andrews to the ‘Acts of Martyrs’ completely fails to establish
his dictum respecting the question alleged to have
been put to the martyrs, and it also appearing that there
existed strong and obvious reasons for not placing implicit
reliance upon that dictum, what are we to think of
Mr. Gurney’s regard for truth, when we find he does not
scruple to tell his readers that the ‘stated day’ mentioned
in Pliny’s letter as that on which the Christians held their
religious assemblies, was ‘clearly the first day of the
week,’ is proved by the very question which it was customary
for the Roman persecutors to address to the martyrs,
<i>Dominicum servasti?</i>—‘Hast thou kept the Lord’s
day?’ For this unqualified assertion, prefixed as it is by
the word ‘clearly,’ in order to make it the more impressive,
Mr. Gurney is without any excuse.”<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The justice of Domville’s language cannot be
questioned when he characterizes this favorite
first-day argument as—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One of those daring misstatements of facts so frequent
in theological writings, and which, from the confident tone
so generally assumed by the writers on such occasions,
are usually received without examination, and allowed,
in consequence, to pass current for truth.”<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The investigation to which this statement has
been subjected, shows, 1. That no such question
as, Hast thou kept the Lord’s day? is upon record
as proposed to the martyrs in the time of Pliny.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
2. That no such question was asked to any martyr
prior to the commencement of the fourth
century. 3. That a single instance of martyrdom
in which any question of the kind was asked,
is all that can be claimed. 4. That in this one
case, which is all that has even the slightest appearance
of sustaining the story under examination,
a correct translation of the original Latin
shows that the question had no relation whatever
to the observance of Sunday! All this has been
upon the assumption that the <i>Acta Martyrum</i>, in
which this story is found, is an authentic work.
Let Mosheim testify relative to the character of
this work for veracity:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to those accounts which have come down to us
under the title of <i>Acta Martyrum</i>, or, the Acts of the
Martyrs, their authority is certainly for the most part
of a very questionable nature; indeed, speaking generally,
it might be coming nearer to the truth, perhaps,
were we to say that they are entitled to no sort of credit
whatever.”<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the authority of the work from which
this story is taken. It is not strange that first-day
historians should leave the repetition of it to
theologians.</p>

<p>Such are the facts respecting this extraordinary
falsehood. They constitute so complete an exposure
of this famous historical argument for
Sunday as to consign it to the just contempt of
all honest men. But this is too valuable an argument
to be lightly surrendered, and moreover
it is as truthful as are certain other of the historical
arguments for Sunday. It will not do to
give up this argument because of its dishonesty;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
for others will have to go with it for possessing
the same character.</p>

<p>Since the publication of Domville’s elaborate
work, James Gilfillan of Scotland has written a
large volume entitled, “The Sabbath,” which has
been extensively circulated both in Europe and
in America, and is esteemed a standard work by
the American Tract Society and by first-day denominations
in general. Gilfillan had read Domville
as appears from his statements on pages 10,
142, 143, 616, of his volume. He was therefore
acquainted with Domville’s exposure of the fraud
respecting “<i>Dominicum servasti?</i>” But though
he was acquainted with this exposure, he offers
not one word in reply. On the contrary, he repeats
the story with as much assurance as though
it had not been proved a falsehood. But as
Domville had shown up the matter from the
<i>Acta Martyrum</i>, it was necessary for Gilfillan to
trace it to some other authority, and so he assigns
it to Cardinal Baronius. Here are Gilfillan’s
words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From the days of the apostles downwards for many
years, the followers of Christ had no enemies more fierce
and unrelenting than that people [the Jews], who cursed
them in the synagogue, sent out emissaries into all countries
to calumniate their Master and them, and were abettors
wherever they could, of the martyrdom of men, such
as Polycarp, of whom the world was not worthy. Among
the reasons of this deadly enmity was the change of the
Sabbatic day. The Romans, though they had no objection
on this score, punished the Christians for the faithful
observance of their day of rest, one of the testing questions
put to the martyrs being, <i>Dominicum servasti?</i>—Have
you kept the Lord’s day?—<i>Baron. An. Eccles.</i>, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
303, Num. 35, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>Gilfillan having reproduced this statement and
assigned as his authority the annalist Baronius,
more recent first-day writers take courage and
repeat the story after him. Now they are all
right, as they think. What if the <i>Acta Martyrum</i>
has failed them? Domville ought to have
gone to Baronius, who, in their judgment, is the
true source of information in this matter. Had he
done this, they say, he would have been saved
from misleading his readers. But let us ascertain
what evil Domville has done in this case. It all
consists in the assertion of two things out of the
<i>Acta Martyrum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>1. That no such question as “<i>Dominicum servasti?</i>”
was addressed to any martyr till the
early part of the fourth century, some two hundred
years after the time of Pliny.</p>

<p>2. That the question even then did not relate
to what is called the Lord’s day, but to the Lord’s
supper.</p>

<p>Now it is a remarkable fact that Gilfillan has
virtually admitted the truth of the first of these
statements, for the earliest instance which he
could find in Baronius is <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 303, as his reference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
plainly shows. It differs only one year from
the date assigned in Ruinart’s <i>Acta Martyrum</i>,
and relates to the very case which Domville has
quoted from that work! Domville’s first and
most important statement is therefore vindicated
by Gilfillan himself, though he has not the frankness
to say this in so many words.</p>

<p>Domville’s second point is that <i>Dominicum</i>,
when used as a noun, as in the present case, signifies
either a church or the Lord’s supper, but
never signifies Lord’s day. He establishes the
fact by incontestible evidence. Gilfillan was acquainted
with all this. He could not answer
Domville, and yet he was not willing to abandon
the falsehood which Domville had exposed. So
he turns from the <i>Acta Martyrum</i> in which the
compiler expressly defines the word to mean
precisely what Domville asserts, and brings forward
the great Romish annalist, Cardinal Baronius.
Now, say our first-day friends, we are to
have the truth from a high authority. Gilfillan
has found in Baronius an express statement that
the martyrs were tested by the question, “Have
you kept the Lord’s day?” No matter then as
to the <i>Acta Martyrum</i> from which Bishop Andrews
first produced this story. That, indeed,
has failed us, but we have in its stead the weighty
testimony of the great Baronius. To be sure he fixes
this test no earlier than the fourth century, which
renders it of no avail as proof that Pliny’s stated
day was Sunday; but it is worth much to have
Baronius bear witness that certain martyrs in
the fourth century were put to death because
they observed the Sunday-Lord’s day.</p>

<p>But these exultant thoughts are vain. I must
state a grave fact in plain language: Gilfillan has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
deliberately falsified the testimony of Baronius!
That historian records at length the martyrdom
of Saturninus and his company in northern
Africa in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 303. It is the very story which
Domville has cited from the <i>Acta Martyrum</i>, and
Baronius repeatedly indicates that he himself
copied it from that work. He gives the various
questions propounded by the proconsul, and the
several answers which were returned by each of
the martyrs. I copy from Baronius the most important
of these. They were arrested while they
were celebrating the Lord’s sacrament according
to custom.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> The following is the charge on which
they were arrested: They had celebrated the
<i>Collectam Dominicam</i> against the command of
the emperors.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The proconsul asked the first
whether he had celebrated the <i>Collectam</i>, and he
replied that he was a Christian, and had done
this.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Another says, “I have not only been in
the <i>Collecta</i>, but I have celebrated the <i>Dominicum</i>
with the brethren because I am a Christian.”<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
Another says we have celebrated the <i>Dominicum</i>,
because the <i>Dominicum</i> cannot be neglected.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>
Another said that the Collecta was made (or observed)
at his house.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The proconsul questioning
again one of those already examined, received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
this answer: “The <i>Dominicum</i> cannot be disregarded,
the law so commands.”<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> When one was
asked whether the <i>Collecta</i> was made (or observed)
at his house, he answered, “In my house
we have celebrated the <i>Dominicum</i>.” He added,
“Without the <i>Dominicum</i> we cannot be,” or live.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
To another, the proconsul said that he did not
wish to know whether he was a Christian, but
whether he participated in the <i>Collecta</i>. His
reply was: “As if one could be a Christian without
the <i>Dominicum</i>, or as if the <i>Dominicum</i> can
be celebrated without the Christian.”<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> And he
said further to the proconsul: “We have observed
the <i>Collecta</i> most sacredly; we have always
convened in the <i>Dominicum</i> for reading the
Lord’s word.”<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Another said: “I have been in
[literally, have made] the <i>Collecta</i> with my
brethren, I have celebrated the <i>Dominicum</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
After him another proclaimed the <i>Dominicum</i> to
be the hope and safety of the Christian, and when
tortured as the others, he exclaimed, ”I have celebrated
the <i>Dominicum</i> with a devoted heart, and
with my brethren I have made the <i>Collecta</i> because
I am a Christian.”<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> When the proconsul again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
asked one of these whether he had conducted the
<i>Dominicum</i>, he replied that he had because Christ
was his Saviour.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>I have thus given the substance of this famous
examination, and have set before the reader the
references therein made to the <i>Dominicum</i>. It
is to be observed that <i>Collecta</i> is used as another
name for <i>Dominicum</i>. Now does Baronius use
either of these words to signify Lord’s day? It
so happens that he has defined these words with
direct reference to this very case no less than
seven times. Now let us read these seven definitions:—</p>

<p>When Baronius records the first question addressed
to these martyrs, he there defines these
words as follows: “By the words <i>Collectam</i>, <i>Collectionem</i>,
and <i>Dominicum</i>, the author always
understands the sacrifice of the Mass.”<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> After
recording the words of that martyr who said that
the law commanded the observance of the <i>Dominicum</i>,
Baronius defines his statement thus:
“Evidently the Christian law concerning the <i>Dominicum</i>,
no doubt about celebrating the sacrifice.”<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
Baronius, by the Romish words sacrifice
and Mass refers to the celebration of the Lord’s
supper by these martyrs. At the conclusion of
the examination, he again defines the celebration
of the <i>Dominicum</i>. He says: “It has been
shown above in relating these things that the
Christians were moved, even in the time of severe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
persecution, to celebrate the <i>Dominicum</i>.
Evidently, as we have declared elsewhere in many
places, it was a sacrifice without bloodshed, and
of divine appointment.”<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> He presently defines
<i>Dominicum</i> again, saying, “Though it is a fact
that the same expression was employed at times
with reference to the <i>temple</i> of God, yet since all
the churches upon the earth have united in this
matter, and from other things related above, it
has been sufficiently shown concerning the celebration
of the <i>Dominicum</i>, <i>that only the sacrifice
of the Mass can be understood</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Observe this
last statement. He says though the word has
been employed to designate the temple of the
Lord, yet in the things here related it can <i>only</i>
signify the sacrifice of the Mass. These testimonies
are exceedingly explicit. But Baronius has
not yet finished. In the index to Tome 3, he
explains these words again with direct reference
to this very martyrdom. Thus under <i>Collecta</i> is
this statement: “The <i>Collecta</i>, the <i>Dominicum</i>,
the Mass, the same [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>] 303, xxxix.”<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Under
<i>Missa</i>: “The Mass is the same as the <i>Collecta</i>, or
<i>Dominicum</i> [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>], 303, xxxix.”<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Under <i>Dominicum</i>:
“To celebrate the <i>Dominicum</i> is the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
as to conduct the Mass [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>], 303, xxxix.; xlix.;
li.”<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>It is not possible to mistake the meaning of
Baronius. He says that <i>Dominicum</i> signifies
the Mass! The celebration of the supper by
these martyrs was doubtless very different from
the pompous ceremony which the church of
Rome now observes under the name of Mass.
But it was the sacrament of the Lord’s supper,
concerning which they were tested, and for observing
which they were put to a cruel death.
The word <i>Dominicum</i> signifies “the sacred mysteries,”
as Ruinart defines it; and Baronius, in
<i>seven</i> times affirming <i>this</i> definition, though acknowledging
that it has sometimes been used to
signify temple of God, plainly declares that in
this record, it can have <i>no other meaning</i> than
that service which the Romanists call the sacrifice
of the Mass. Gilfillan had read all this, yet
he dares to quote Baronius as saying that these
martyrs were tested by the question, “Have you
kept Lord’s day?” He could not but know that
he was writing a direct falsehood; but he thought
the honor of God, and the advancement of the
cause of truth, demanded this act at his hands.</p>

<p>Before Gilfillan wrote his work, Domville had
called attention to the fact that the sentence,
“<i>Dominicum servasti?</i>” does not occur in the
<i>Acta Martyrum</i>, a different verb being used every
time. But this is the popular form of this
question, and must not be given up. So Gilfillan
declares that Baronius uses it in his record of the
martyrdoms in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 303. But we have cited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
the different forms of question recorded by Baronius,
and find them to be precisely the same with
those of the <i>Acta Martyrum</i>. “<i>Dominicum servasti?</i>”
does not occur in that historian, and Gilfillan,
in stating that it does, is guilty of untruth.
This, however, is comparatively unimportant. But
for asserting that Baronius speaks of Lord’s day
under the name of <i>Dominicum</i>, Gilfillan stands
convicted of inexcusable falsehood in matters of
serious importance.</p>

<span class="smaller">ORIGIN OF FIRST-DAY OBSERVANCE.</span></h3>

<p>Sunday a heathen festival from remote antiquity—Origin of
the name—Reasons which induced the leaders of the
church to adopt this festival—It was the day generally
observed by the Gentiles in the first centuries of the
Christian era—To have taken a different day would have
been exceedingly inconvenient—They hoped to facilitate
the conversion of the Gentiles by keeping the same day
that they observed—Three voluntary weekly festivals in
the church in memory of the Redeemer—Sunday soon elevated
above the other two—Justin Martyr—Sunday observance
first found in the church of Rome—Irenæus—First
act of papal usurpation was in behalf of Sunday—Tertullian—Earliest
trace of abstinence from labor on
Sunday—General statement of facts—The Roman church
made its first great attack upon the Sabbath by turning it
into a fast.</p>

</div>

<p>The festival of Sunday is more ancient than
the Christian religion, its origin being lost in remote
antiquity. It did not originate, however,
from any divine command nor from piety toward
God: on the contrary, it was set apart as a sacred
day by the heathen world in honor of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
chief god, the sun. It is from this fact that the
first day of the week has obtained the name of
Sunday, a name by which it is known in many
languages. Webster thus defines the word:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sunday; so called because this day was anciently
dedicated to the sun or to its worship. The first day of
the week; the Christian Sabbath; a day consecrated to
rest from secular employments, and to religious worship;
the Lord’s day.”</p>

</div>

<p>And Worcester, in his large dictionary, uses
similar language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sunday; so named because anciently dedicated to the
sun or to its worship. The first day of the week; the
Christian Sabbath, consecrated to rest from labor and to
religious worship; the Lord’s day.”</p>

</div>

<p>These lexicographers call Sunday the Christian
Sabbath, etc., because in the general theological
literature of our language, it is thus designated,
though never thus in the Bible. Lexicographers
do not undertake to settle theological questions,
but simply to define terms as currently used in a
particular language. Though all the other days
of the week have heathen names, Sunday alone
was a conspicuous heathen festival in the days of
the early church. The <i>North British Review</i>, in
a labored attempt to justify the observance of
Sunday by the Christian world, styles that day,
“<span class="smcap">The wild solar holiday</span> [<i>i. e.</i>, festival in honor
of the sun] <span class="smcap">of all pagan times</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>Verstegan says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The most ancient Germans being pagans, and having
appropriated their first day of the week to the peculiar
adoration of the sun, whereof that day doth yet in our
English tongue retain the name of Sunday, and appropriated
the next day unto it unto the especial adoration of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
the moon, whereof it yet retaineth with us, the name of
Monday; they ordained the next day to these most heavenly
planets to the particular adoration of their great reputed
god, Tuisco, whereof we do yet retain in our language
the name of Tuesday.”<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same author thus speaks concerning the
idols of our Saxon ancestors:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of these, though they had many, yet seven among
the rest they especially appropriated unto the seven days
of the week.... Unto the day dedicated unto
the especial adoration of the idol of the sun, they gave
the name of Sunday, as much as to say the sun’s day or
the day of the sun. This idol was placed in a temple,
and there adored and sacrificed unto, for that they believed
that the sun in the firmament did with or in this
idol correspond and co-operate.”<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Jennings makes this adoration of the sun more
ancient than the deliverance of Israel from Egypt.
For, in speaking of the time of that deliverance,
he speaks of the Gentiles as,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The idolatrous nations who in honor to their chief
god, the sun, began their day at his rising.”<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He represents them also as setting apart Sunday
in honor of the same object of adoration:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The day which the heathens in general consecrated
to the worship and honor of their chief god, the sun,
which, according to our computation, was the first day of
the week.”<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The <i>North British Review</i> thus defends the introduction
of this ancient heathen festival into
the Christian church:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That very day was the Sunday of their heathen neighbors
and respective countrymen; and patriotism gladly
united with expediency in making it at once their Lord’s
day and their Sabbath.... If the authority of the
church is to be ignored altogether by Protestants, there
is no matter; because opportunity and common expediency
are surely argument enough for so ceremonial a
change as the mere day of the week for the observance
of the rest and holy convocation of the Jewish Sabbath.
That primitive church, in fact, was shut up to the adoption
of the Sunday, until it became established and supreme,
when it was too late to make another alteration;
and it was no irreverent nor undelightful thing to adopt
it, inasmuch as the first day of the week was their own
high day at any rate; so that their compliance and civility
were rewarded by the redoubled sanctity of their quiet
festival.”<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It would seem that something more potent than
“patriotism” and “expediency” would be requisite
to transform this heathen festival into the
Christian Sabbath, or even to justify its introduction
into the Christian church. A further statement
of the reasons which prompted its introduction,
and a brief notice of the earlier steps toward
transforming it into a Christian institution, will occupy
the remainder of this chapter. Chafie, a clergyman
of the English Church, in 1652, published a
work in vindication of first-day observance, entitled,
“The Seventh-day Sabbath.” After showing
the general observance of Sunday by the heathen
world in the early ages of the church, Chafie
thus states the reasons which forbid the Christians
attempting to keep any other day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. Because of the contempt, scorn, and derision they
thereby should be had in, among all the Gentiles with
whom they lived.... How grievous would be their
taunts and reproaches against the poor Christians living
with them and under their power for their new set sacred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
day, had the Christians chosen any other than the Sunday....
2. Most Christians then were either servants
or of the poorer sort of people; and the Gentiles,
most probably, would not give their servants liberty to
cease from working on any other set day constantly, except
on their Sunday.... 3. Because had they assayed
such a change it would have been but labor in
vain; ... they could never have brought it to pass.”<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus it is seen that at the time when the early
church began to apostatize from God and to foster
in its bosom human ordinances, the heathen
world—as they had long done—very generally
observed the first day of the week in honor of
the sun. Many of the early fathers of the church
had been heathen philosophers. Unfortunately
they brought with them into the church many
of their old notions and principles. Particularly
did it occur to them that by uniting with
the heathen in the day of weekly celebration
they should greatly facilitate their conversion.
The reasons which induced the church to adopt
the ancient festival of the heathen as something
made ready to hand, are thus stated by Morer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not to be denied but we borrow the name of this
day from the ancient Greeks and Romans, and we allow
that the old Egyptians worshiped the sun, and as a standing
<i>memorial</i> of their veneration, dedicated this day to
him. And we find by the influence of their examples,
<i>other</i> nations, and among them the Jews themselves, doing
him homage;<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> yet these abuses did not hinder the
fathers of the Christian church simply to repeal, or altogether
lay by, the day or its name, but only to sanctify
and improve both, as they did also the pagan temples
polluted before with idolatrous services, and other instances
wherein those good men were always tender to
work any other change than what was evidently necessary,
and in such things as were plainly inconsistent with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the Christian religion; so that Sunday being the day on
which the Gentiles solemnly adored that planet, and
called it Sunday, partly from its influence on that day
especially, and partly in respect to its divine body (as
they conceived it), the Christians thought fit to keep the
same day and the same name of it, that they might not
appear causelessly peevish, and by that means hinder the
conversion of the Gentiles, and bring a greater prejudice
than might be otherwise taken against the gospel.”<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the time of Justin Martyr, Sunday was a
weekly festival, widely celebrated by the heathen
in honor of their god, the sun. And so, in presenting
to the heathen emperor of Rome an
“Apology” for his brethren, Justin takes care to
tell him thrice that the Christians held their assemblies
on this day of general observance.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
Sunday therefore makes its first appearance in
the Christian church as an institution identical
in time with the weekly festival of the heathen,
and Justin, who first mentions this festival, had
been a heathen philosopher. Sixty years later,
Tertullian acknowledges that it was not without
an appearance of truth that men declared the
sun to be the god of the Christians. But he answered
that though they worshiped toward the
east like the heathen, and devoted Sunday to rejoicing,
it was for a reason far different from sun-worship.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
And on another occasion, in defending
his brethren from the charge of sun-worship, he
acknowledges that these acts, prayer toward the
east, and making Sunday a day of festivity, did
give men a chance to think the sun was the God
of the Christians.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Tertullian is therefore a witness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
to the fact that Sunday was a heathen festival
when it obtained a foothold in the Christian
church, and that the Christians, in consequence of
observing it, were taunted with being sun-worshipers.
It is remarkable that in his replies
he never claims for their observance any divine
precept or apostolic example. His principal
point was that they had as good a right to do
it as the heathen had. One hundred and twenty
one years after Tertullian, Constantine, while yet
a heathen, put forth his famous edict in behalf of
the heathen festival of the sun, which day he
pronounced “venerable.” And this heathen law
caused the day to be observed everywhere
throughout the Roman Empire, and firmly established
it both in Church and State. It is certain,
therefore, that at the time of its entrance into
the Christian church, Sunday was an ancient
weekly festival of the heathen world.</p>

<p>That this heathen festival was upon the day of
Christ’s resurrection doubtless powerfully contributed
to aid “patriotism” and “expediency” in
transforming it into the Lord’s day or Christian
Sabbath. For, with pious motives, as we may
reasonably conclude, the professed people of God
early paid a voluntary regard to several days,
memorable in the history of the Redeemer. Mosheim,
whose testimony in behalf of Sunday has
been presented already, uses the following language
relative to the crucifixion day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is also probable that Friday, the day of Christ’s
crucifixion, was early distinguished by particular honors
from the other days of the week.”<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And of the second century, he says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Many also observed the fourth day of the week, on
which Christ was betrayed; and the sixth, which was the
day of his crucifixion.”<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Peter Heylyn says of those who chose
Sunday:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Because our Saviour rose that day from amongst the
dead, so chose they Friday for another, by reason of our
Saviour’s passion; and Wednesday on the which he had
been betrayed: the Saturday, or ancient Sabbath, being
meanwhile retained in the eastern churches.”<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of the comparative sacredness of these three
voluntary festivals, the same writer testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If we consider either the preaching of the word, the
ministration of the sacraments, or the public prayers: the
Sunday in the eastern churches had no great prerogative
above other days, especially above the Wednesday and
the Friday, save that the meetings were more solemn,
and the concourse of people greater than at other times,
as is most likely.”<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And besides these three weekly festivals, there
were also two annual festivals of great sacredness.
These were the Passover and the Pentecost.
And it is worthy of special notice that although
the Sunday festival can be traced no
higher in the church than Justin Martyr, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
140, the Passover can be traced to a man who
claimed to have received it from the apostles.
<a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">See chapter thirteen.</a> Among these festivals,
considered simply as voluntary memorials of the
Redeemer, Sunday had very little pre-eminence.
For it is well stated by Heylyn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Take which you will, either the fathers or the moderns,
and we shall find no Lord’s day instituted by any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
apostolical mandate; no Sabbath set on foot by them upon
the first day of the week.”<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Domville bears the following testimony, which
is worthy of lasting remembrance:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Not any ecclesiastical writer of the first three centuries
attributed the origin of Sunday observance either to
Christ or to his apostles.”<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

</div>

<p>“Patriotism” and “expediency,” however, erelong
elevated immeasurably above its fellows that
one of these voluntary festivals which corresponded
to “the wild solar holiday” of the heathen
world, making that day at last “the Lord’s day”
of the Christian church. The earliest testimony
in behalf of first-day observance that has <i>any</i>
claim to be regarded as genuine is that of Justin
Martyr, written about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140. Before his conversion,
he was a heathen philosopher. The time,
place, and occasion of his first Apology or Defense
of the Christians, addressed to the Roman Emperor,
is thus stated by an eminent Roman Catholic
historian. He says that Justin Martyr</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Was at Rome when the persecution that was raised
under the reign of Antoninus Pius, the successor of Adrian,
began to break forth, where he composed an excellent
apology in behalf of the Christians.”<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of the works ascribed to Justin Martyr, Milner
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Like many of the ancient fathers he appears to us under
the greatest disadvantage. Works really his have
been lost; and others have been ascribed to him, part of
which are not his; and the rest, at least, of ambiguous
authority.”<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>If the writings ascribed to him are genuine,
there is little propriety in the use made of his
name by the advocates of the first-day Sabbath.
He taught the abrogation of the Sabbatic institution;
and there is no intimation in his words that
the Sunday festival which he mentions was other
than a voluntary observance. Thus he addresses
the emperor of Rome:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And upon the day called Sunday, all that live either
in city or country meet together at the same place, where
the writings of the apostles and prophets are read, as
much as time will give leave; when the reader has done,
the bishop makes a sermon, wherein he instructs the people,
and animates them to the practice of such lovely precepts:
at the conclusion of this discourse, we all rise up
together and pray; and prayers being over, as I now said,
there is bread and wine and water offered, and the bishop,
as before, sends up prayers and thanksgivings, with
all the fervency he is able, and the people conclude all
with the joyful acclamation of Amen. Then the consecrated
elements are distributed to, and partaken of, by
all that are present, and sent to the absent by the hands
of the deacons. But the wealthy and the willing, for every
one is at liberty, contribute as they think fitting;
and this collection is deposited with the bishop, and out
of this he relieves the orphan and the widow, and such as
are reduced to want by sickness or any other cause, and
such as are in bonds, and strangers that come from far;
and, in a word, he is the guardian and almoner to all the
indigent. Upon Sunday we all assemble, that being the
first day in which God set himself to work upon the dark
void, in order to make the world, and in which Jesus
Christ our Saviour rose again from the dead; for the day
before Saturday he was crucified, and the day after,
which is Sunday, he appeared unto his apostles and disciples,
and taught them what I have now proposed to
your consideration.”<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This passage, if genuine, furnishes the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
reference to the observance of Sunday as a religious
festival in the Christian church. It should
be remembered that this language was written at
Rome, and addressed directly to the emperor. It
shows therefore what was the practice of the
church in that city and vicinity, but does not determine
how extensive this observance was. It
contains strong incidental proof that apostasy
had made progress at Rome; the institution of
the Lord’s supper being changed in part already
to a human ordinance; water being now as essential
to the Lord’s supper as the wine or the
bread. And what is still more dangerous as perverting
the institution of Christ, the consecrated
elements were sent to the absent, a step which
speedily resulted in their becoming objects of superstitious
veneration, and finally of worship.
Justin tells the emperor that Christ thus ordained;
but such a statement is a grave departure
from the truth of the New Testament.</p>

<p>This statement of reasons for Sunday observance
is particularly worthy of attention. He tells
the emperor that they assembled upon the day
called Sunday. This was equivalent to saying
to him, We observe the day on which our fellow-citizens
offer their adoration to the sun. Here
both “patriotism” and “expediency” discover
themselves in the words of Justin, which were
addressed to a persecuting emperor in behalf of
the Christians. But as if conscious that the observance
of a heathen festival as the day of Christian
worship was not consistent with their profession
as worshipers of the Most High, Justin
bethinks himself for reasons in defense of this observance.
He assigns no divine precept nor apostolic
example for this festival. For his reference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
to what Christ taught his disciples, as appears
from the connection, was to the general system
of the Christian religion, and not to the observance
of Sunday. If it be said that Justin might
have learned from tradition what is not to be
found in the New Testament relative to Sunday
observance, and that after all Sunday may be a
divinely-appointed festival, it is sufficient to answer,
1. That this plea would show only tradition
in favor of the Sunday festival. 2. That
Justin Martyr is a very unsafe guide; his testimony
relative to the Lord’s supper differs from
that of the New Testament. 3. That the American
Tract Society, in a work which it publishes
against Romanism, bears the following testimony
relative to the point before us:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Justin Martyr appears indeed peculiarly unfitted to
lay claim to authority. It is notorious that he supposed
a pillar erected on the island of the Tiber to Semo Sanchus,
an old Sabine deity, to be a monument erected by
the Roman people in honor of the impostor Simon Magus.
Were so gross a mistake to be made by a modern writer
in relating a historical fact, exposure would immediately
take place, and his testimony would thenceforward be
suspected. And assuredly the same measure should be
meted to Justin Martyr, who so egregiously errs in reference
to a fact alluded to by Livy the historian.”<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Justin assigns the following reasons in support
of Sunday observance: “That being the first day
in which God set himself to work upon the dark
void in order to make the world, and in which
Jesus Christ our Saviour rose again from the
dead.” Bishop Jeremy Taylor most fittingly replies
to this:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first of these looks more like an excuse than a
just reason; for if anything of the creation were made the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
cause of a Sabbath, it ought to be the end, not the beginning;
it ought to be the rest, not the first part of the
work; it ought to be that which God assigned, not [that]
which man should take by way of after justification.”<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is to be observed, therefore, that the first
trace of Sunday as a Christian festival is found
in the church of Rome. Soon after this time, and
thenceforward, we shall find “the bishop” of that
church making vigorous efforts to suppress the
Sabbath of the Lord, and to elevate in its stead
the festival of Sunday.</p>

<p>It is proper to note the fact also that Justin
was a decided opponent of the ancient Sabbath.
In his “Dialogue with Trypho the Jew” he thus
addressed him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This new law teaches you to observe a perpetual Sabbath;
and you, when you have spent one day in idleness,
think you have discharged the duties of religion.... If
any one is guilty of adultery, let him repent, then he hath
kept the true and delightful Sabbath unto God.... For
we really should observe that circumcision which is in the
flesh, and the Sabbath, and all the feasts, if we had not
known the reason why they were imposed upon you,
namely, upon the account of your iniquities.... It was
because of your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers,
that God appointed you to observe the Sabbath....
You see that the heavens are not idle, nor do they
observe the Sabbath. Continue as ye were born. For
if before Abraham there was no need of circumcision, nor
of the sabbaths, nor of feasts, nor of offerings before Moses;
so now in like manner there is no need of them, since
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was by the determinate
counsel of God, born of a virgin of the seed of Abraham
without sin.”<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This reasoning of Justin deserves no reply. It
shows, however, the unfairness of Dr. Edwards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
who quotes Justin Martyr as a witness for the
change of the Sabbath;<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> whereas Justin held
that God made the Sabbath on account of the
wickedness of the Jews, and that he totally abrogated
it in consequence of the first advent of
Christ; the Sunday festival of the heathen being
evidently adopted by the church at Rome from
motives of “expediency” and perhaps of “patriotism.”
The testimony of Justin, if genuine, is
peculiarly valuable in one respect. It shows that
as late as <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140 the first day of the week had
acquired no title of sacredness; for Justin several
times mentions the day: thrice as “the day called
Sunday” and twice as “the eighth day;” and by
other terms also, but never by any sacred name.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>The next important witness in behalf of first-day
sacredness is thus presented by Dr. Edwards:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hence Irenæus, bishop of Lyons, a disciple of Polycarp,
who had been the companion of the apostles, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
167, says that the Lord’s day was the Christian Sabbath.
His words are, ‘On the Lord’s day every one of us Christians
keeps the Sabbath, meditating on the law and rejoicing
in the works of God.’”<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This testimony is highly valued by first-day
writers, and is often and prominently set forth in
their publications. Sir Wm. Domville, whose
elaborate treatise on the Sabbath has been several
times quoted, states the following important fact
relative to this quotation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have carefully searched through all the extant
works of Irenæus and can with certainty state that no
such passage, or any one at all resembling it, is there to
be found. The edition I consulted was that by Massuet
(Paris, 1710); but to assure myself still further, I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
since looked to the editions by Erasmus (Paris, 1563), and
Grabe (Oxford, 1702), and in neither do I find the passage
in question.”<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that those who quote
this as the language of Irenæus, if they give any
reference, cite their readers to Dwight’s Theology
instead of referring them to the place in the
works of Irenæus where it is to be found. It was
Dr. Dwight who first enriched the theological
world with this invaluable quotation. Where,
then, did Dwight obtain this testimony which has
so many times been given as that of Irenæus?
On this point Domville remarks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He had the misfortune to be afflicted with a disease
in his eyes from the early age of twenty-three, a calamity
(says his biographer) by which he was deprived of the capacity
for reading and study.... The knowledge
which he gained from books after the period above mentioned
[by which the editor must mean his age of twenty-three]
was almost exclusively at second hand, by the aid
of others.”<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Domville states another fact which gives us
unquestionably the origin of this quotation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But although not to be found in Irenæus, there are
in the writings ascribed to another father, namely, in the
interpolated epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians, and in
one of its interpolated passages, expressions so clearly resembling
those of Dr. Dwight’s quotation as to leave no
doubt of the source from which he quoted.”<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such, then, is the end of this famous testimony
of Irenæus, who had it from Polycarp, who
had it from the apostles! It was furnished the
world by a man whose eyesight was impaired;
who in consequence of this infirmity took at second
hand an interpolated passage from an epistle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
falsely ascribed to Ignatius, and published it to
the world as the genuine testimony of Irenæus.
Loss of eyesight, as we may charitably believe,
led Dr. Dwight into the serious error which he
has committed; but by the publication of this
spurious testimony, which seemed to come in a
direct line from the apostles, he has rendered
multitudes as incapable of reading aright the
fourth commandment, as he, by loss of natural
eyesight, was of reading Irenæus for himself.
This case admirably illustrates tradition as a
religious guide; it is the blind leading the blind
until both fall into the ditch.</p>

<p>Nor is this all that should be said in the case
of Irenæus. In all his writings there is <i>no instance</i>
in which he calls Sunday the Lord’s day!
And what is also very remarkable, there is no
sentence extant written by him in which he even
mentions the first day of the week!<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> It appears,
however, from several statements in ancient writers,
that he did mention the day, though no sentence
of <i>his</i> in which it is mentioned is in existence.
He held that the Sabbath was a typical
institution, which pointed to the seventh thousand
years as the great day of rest to the church;<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
he said that Abraham was “without observance
of Sabbaths;”<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> and yet he makes the origin of
the Sabbath to be the sanctification of the seventh
day.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> But he expressly asserts the perpetuity
and authority of the ten commandments,
declaring that they are identical with the law of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
nature implanted from the beginning in mankind,
that they remain permanently with us, and that
if any one does not observe them he has no salvation.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the first instance
upon record in which the bishop of Rome attempted
to rule the Christian church was by <span class="smcap">an
edict in behalf of Sunday</span>. It had been the
custom of all the churches to celebrate the passover,
but with this difference: that while the eastern
churches observed it upon the fourteenth day
of the first month, no matter what day of the
week this might be, the western churches kept
it upon the Sunday following that day; or rather,
upon the Sunday following Good Friday.
Victor, bishop of Rome, in the year 196,<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> took
upon him to impose the Roman custom upon all
the churches; that is, to compel them to observe
the passover upon Sunday. “This bold attempt,”
says Bower, “we may call the first essay of papal
usurpation.”<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> And Dowling terms it the
“earliest instance of Romish assumption.”<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> The
churches of Asia Minor informed Victor that they
could not comply with his lordly mandate. Then,
says Bower:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon the receipt of this letter, Victor, giving the
reins to an impotent and ungovernable passion, published
bitter invectives against all the churches of Asia, declared
them cut off from his communion, sent letters of
excommunication to their respective bishops; and, at the
same time, in order to have them cut off from the communion
of the whole church, wrote to the other bishops,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
exhorting them to follow his example, and forbear communicating
with their refractory brethren of Asia.”<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The historian informs us that “not one followed
his example or advice; not one paid any
sort of regard to his letters, or showed the least
inclination to second him in such a rash and uncharitable
attempt.” He further says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Victor being thus baffled in his attempt, his successors
took care not to revive the controversy; so that the
Asiatics peaceably followed their ancient practice till the
Council of Nice, which out of complaisance to Constantine
the Great, ordered the solemnity of Easter to be kept
everywhere on the same day, after the custom of Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The victory was not obtained for Sunday in
this struggle, as Heylyn testifies,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Till the great Council of Nice [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 325] backed by
the authority of as great an emperor [Constantine] settled
it better than before; none but some scattered schismatics,
now and then appearing, that durst oppose the resolution
of that famous synod.”<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Constantine, by whose powerful influence the
Council of Nice was induced to decide this question
in favor of the Roman bishop, that is, to fix
the passover upon Sunday, urged the following
strong reason for the measure:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let us then have nothing in common with the most
hostile rabble of the Jews.”<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This sentence is worthy of notice. A determination
to have nothing in common with the
Jews had very much to do with the suppression
of the Sabbath in the Christian church. Those
who rejected the Sabbath of the Lord and chose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
in its stead the more popular and more convenient
Sunday festival of the heathen, were so infatuated
with the idea of having nothing in common
with the Jews, that they never even questioned
the propriety of a festival in common with
the heathen.</p>

<p>This festival was not weekly, but annual; but
the removal of it from the fourteenth of the
first month to the Sunday following Good Friday
was the first legislation attempted in honor
of Sunday as a Christian festival; and as Heylyn
quaintly expresses it, “The Lord’s day found it
no small matter to obtain the victory.”<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> In a
brief period after the Council of Nice, by the
laws of Theodosius, capital punishment was inflicted
upon those who should celebrate the feast
of the passover upon any other day than Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
The Britons of Wales were long able to
maintain their ground against this favorite project
of the Roman church, and as late as the sixth
century “obstinately resisted the imperious mandates
of the Roman pontiffs.”<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>Four years after the commencement of the
struggle just narrated, bring us to the testimony
of Tertullian, the oldest of the Latin fathers, who
wrote about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 200. Dr. Clarke tells us that
the fathers “blow hot and cold.” Tertullian is a
fair example of this. He places the origin of the
Sabbath at the creation, but elsewhere says that
the patriarchs did not keep it. He says that
Joshua broke the Sabbath at Jericho, and afterward
shows that he did not break it. He says
that Christ broke the Sabbath, and in another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
place proves that he did not. He represents the
eighth day as more honorable than the seventh,
and elsewhere states the reverse. He states that
the law is abolished, and in other places teaches
its perpetuity and authority. He declares that
the Sabbath was abrogated by Christ, and afterward
asserts that “Christ did not at all rescind
the Sabbath,” but imparted “an additional sanctity”
to “the Sabbath day itself, which from the
beginning had been consecrated by the benediction
of the Father.” And he goes on to say that
Christ “furnished to this day divine safeguards—a
course which his adversary would have pursued
for some other days, to avoid honoring the
Creator’s Sabbath.”</p>

<p>This last statement is very remarkable. The
Saviour furnished additional safeguards to the
Creator’s Sabbath. But “his adversary” would
have done this to some other days. Now it is
plain, first, that Tertullian did not believe that
Christ sanctified some other day to take the place
of the Sabbath; and second, that he believed the
consecration of another day to be the work of the
adversary of God! When he wrote these words
he certainly did not believe in the sanctification
of Sunday by Christ. But Tertullian and his
brethren found themselves observing as a festival
that day on which the sun was worshiped, and
they were, in consequence, taunted with being
worshipers of the sun. Tertullian denies the
charge, though he acknowledges that there was
some appearance of truth to it. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Others, again, certainly with more information and
greater verisimilitude, believe that the sun is our God.
We shall be counted Persians, perhaps, though we do not
worship the orb of day painted on a piece of linen cloth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
having himself everywhere in his own disk. The idea,
no doubt, has originated from our being known to turn
to the east in prayer. But you, many of you, also, under
pretense sometimes of worshiping the heavenly bodies,
move your lips in the direction of the sunrise. In the
same way, if we devote Sunday to rejoicing, from a far
different reason than sun-worship, we have some resemblance
to those of you who devote the day of Saturn to
ease and luxury, though they, too, go far away from Jewish
ways, of which they are ignorant.”<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian pleads no divine command nor apostolic
example for this practice. In fact, he offers
no reason for the practice, though he intimates
that he had one to offer. But he finds it necessary
in another work to repel this same charge
of sun-worship, because of Sunday observance.
In this second answer to this charge he states the
ground of defense more distinctly, and here we
shall find his best reason. These are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Others, with greater regard to good manners, it must
be confessed, suppose that the sun is the god of the
Christians, because it is a well-known fact that we pray
toward the east, or because we make Sunday a day of
festivity. What then? Do you do less than this? Do
not many among you, with an affectation of sometimes
worshiping the heavenly bodies likewise, move your lips
in the direction of the sunrise? It is you, at all events,
who have even admitted the sun into the calendar of the
week; and you have selected its day [Sunday], in preference
to the preceding day, as the most suitable in the
week for either an entire abstinence from the bath, or for
its postponement until the evening, or for taking rest,
and for banqueting. By resorting to these customs, you
deliberately deviate from your own religious rites to those
of strangers.”<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian, in this discourse, addresses himself
to the nations still in idolatry. With some of
these, Sunday was an ancient festival; with others,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
it was of comparatively recent date. But
some of these heathen reproached the Sunday
Christians with being sun-worshipers. And now
observe the answer. He does not say, “We
Christians are commanded to celebrate the first
day of the week in honor of Christ’s resurrection.”
His answer is doubtless the best that he knew
how to frame. It is a mere retort, and consists
in asserting, first, that the Christians had done
no more than their accusers, the heathen; and
second, that they had as good a right to make
Sunday a day of festivity as had the heathen!</p>

<p>The origin of first-day observance has been the
subject of inquiry in this chapter. We have
found that Sunday from remote antiquity was
a heathen festival in honor of the sun, and that
in the first centuries of the Christian era this
ancient festival was in general veneration in the
heathen world. We have learned that patriotism
and expediency, and a tender regard for the conversion
of the Gentile world, caused the leaders
of the church to adopt as their religious festival
the day observed by the heathen, and to retain
the same name which the heathen had given it.
We have seen that the earliest instance upon record
of the actual observance of Sunday in the
Christian church, is found in the church of Rome
about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140. The first great effort in its behalf,
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 196, is by a singular coincidence the
first act of papal usurpation. The first instance
of a sacred title being applied to this festival,
and the earliest trace of abstinence from labor on
that day, are found in the writings of Tertullian
at the close of the second century. The origin of
the festival of Sunday is now before the reader;
the steps by which it has ascended to supreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
power will be pointed out in their proper order
and place.</p>

<p>One fact of deep interest will conclude this
chapter. The first great effort made to put down
the Sabbath was the act of the church of Rome
in turning it into a fast while Sunday was made
a joyful festival. While the eastern churches retained
the Sabbath, a portion of the western
churches, with the church of Rome at their head,
turned it into a fast. As a part of the western
churches refused to comply with this ordinance,
a long struggle ensued, the result of which is thus
stated by Heylyn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this difference it stood a long time together, till
in the end the Roman church obtained the cause, and
Saturday became a fast almost through all the parts of
the western world. I say the western world, and of that
alone: the eastern churches being so far from altering
their ancient custom that in the sixth council of Constantinople,
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 692, they did admonish those of Rome to
forbear fasting on that day upon pain of censure.”<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Wm. James, in a sermon before the University
of Oxford, thus states the time when this fast
originated:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The western church began to fast on Saturday at the
beginning of the third century.”<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus it is seen that this struggle began with
the third century, that is, immediately after the
year 200. Neander thus states the motive of the
Roman church:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the western churches, particularly the Roman,
where opposition to Judaism was the prevailing tendency,
this very opposition produced the custom of celebrating
the Saturday in particular as a fast day.”<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>By Judaism, Neander meant the observance of
the seventh day as the Sabbath. Dr. Charles
Hase, of Germany, states the object of the Roman
church in very explicit language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Roman church regarded Saturday as a fast day
in direct opposition to those who regarded it as a Sabbath.
Sunday remained a joyful festival in which all fasting
and worldly business was avoided as much as possible,
but the original commandment of the decalogue respecting
the Sabbath was not then applied to that day.”<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Lord King attests this fact in the following
words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some of the western churches, that they might not
seem to Judaize, fasted on Saturday, as Victorinus Petavionensis
writes: We use to fast on the seventh day.
And it is our custom then to fast, that we may not seem,
with the Jews, to observe the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus the Sabbath of the Lord was turned into
a fast in order to render it despicable before men.
Such was the first great effort of the Roman
church toward the suppression of the ancient
Sabbath of the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NATURE OF EARLY FIRST-DAY OBSERVANCE.</span></h3>

<p>The history of first-day observance compared with that of
the popes—First-day observance defined in the very words
of each of the early fathers who mention it—The reasons
which each had for its observance stated in his own words—Sunday
in their judgment of no higher sacredness than
Easter or Whitsunday, or even than the fifty days between
those festivals—Sunday not a day of abstinence from labor—The
reasons which are offered by those of them who
rejected the Sabbath stated in their own words.</p>

</div>

<p>The history of first-day observance in the
Christian church may be fitly illustrated by that
of the bishops of Rome. The Roman bishop now
claims supreme power over all the churches of
Christ. He asserts that this power was given to
Peter, and by him was transmitted to the bishops
of Rome; or rather that Peter was the first Roman
bishop, and that a succession of such bishops
from his time to the present have exercised
this absolute power in the church. They are
able to trace back their line to apostolic times,
and they assert that the power now claimed by
the pope was claimed and exercised by the first
pastors of the church of the Romans. Those who
now acknowledge the supremacy of the pope believe
this assertion, and with them it is a conclusive
evidence that the pope is by divine right
possessed of supreme power. But the assertion
is absolutely false. The early pastors, or bishops,
or elders, of the church of the Romans were modest,
unassuming ministers of Christ, wholly unlike
the arrogant bishop of Rome, who now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
usurps the place of Christ as the head of the
Christian church.</p>

<p>The first day of the week now claims to be
the Christian Sabbath, and enforces its authority
by means of the fourth commandment, having set
aside the seventh day, which that commandment
enjoins, and usurped its place. Its advocates assert
that this position and this authority were
given to it by Christ. As no record of such gift
is found in the Scriptures, the principal argument
in its support is furnished by tracing first-day
observance back to the early Christians,
who, it is said, would not have hallowed the day
if they had not been instructed to do it by the
apostles; and the apostles would not have taught
them to do it if Christ had not, in their presence,
changed the Sabbath.</p>

<p>But first-day observance can be traced no
nearer to apostolic times than <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 140, while
the bishops of Rome can trace their line to the
very times of the apostles. Herein is the papal
claim to apostolic authority better than is that of
the first-day Sabbath. But with this exception,
the historical argument in behalf of each is the
same. Both began with very moderate pretensions,
and gradually gaining in power and sacredness,
grew up in strength together.</p>

<p>Let us now go to those who were the earliest
observers of Sunday and learn from them the
nature of that observance at its commencement.
We shall find, first, that no one claimed for first-day
observance any divine authority; second,
that none of them had ever heard of the change
of the Sabbath, and none believed the first-day
festival to be a continuation of the Sabbatic institution;
third, that labor on that day is never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
set forth as sinful, and that abstinence from labor
is never mentioned as a feature of its observance,
nor even implied, only so far as necessary in order
to spend a portion of the day in worship;
fourth, that if we put together all the hints respecting
Sunday observance, which are scattered
through the fathers of the first three centuries,
for no one of them gives more than two of these,
and generally a single hint is all that is found in
one writer, we shall find just four items: (1) an
assembly on that day in which the Bible was
read and expounded, and the supper celebrated,
and money collected; (2) that the day must be
one of rejoicing; (3) that it must not be a day
of fasting; (4) that the knee must not be bent in
prayer on that day.</p>

<p>The following are all the hints respecting the
nature of first-day observance during the first
three centuries. The epistle falsely ascribed to
Barnabas simply says: “We keep the eighth day
with joyfulness.”<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Justin Martyr, in words already
quoted at full length, describes the kind
of meeting which they held at Rome and in that
vicinity on that day, and this is all that he connects
with its observance.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Irenæus taught that
to commemorate the resurrection, the knee must
not be bent on that day, and mentions nothing
else as essential to its honor. This act of standing
in prayer was a symbol of the resurrection,
which was to be celebrated only on that day, as
he held.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Bardesanes the Gnostic represents the
Christians as everywhere meeting for worship on
that day, but he does not describe that worship,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and he gives no other honor to the day.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Tertullian
describes Sunday observance as follows:
“We devote Sunday to rejoicing,” and he adds,
“We have some resemblance to those of you who
devote the day of Saturn to <i>ease</i> and <i>luxury</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
In another work he gives us a further idea of the
festive character of Sunday. Thus he says to
his brethren: “If any <i>indulgence is to be granted
to the flesh</i>, you have it. I will not say your
own days, but more too; for to the heathens
each festive day occurs but once annually; you
have <i>a festive</i> day <i>every eighth day</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> Dr. Heylyn
spoke the truth when he said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Tertullian tells us that they did devote the Sunday
partly unto mirth and recreation, not to devotion altogether;
when in a hundred years after Tertullian’s time
there was no law or constitution to restrain men from labor
on this day in the Christian church.”<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Sunday festival in Tertullian’s time was
not like the modern first-day Sabbath, but was
essentially the German festival of Sunday, a day
for worship and for recreation, and one on which
labor was not sinful. But Tertullian speaks further
respecting Sunday observance, and the words
now to be quoted have been used as proof that
labor on that day was counted sinful. This is
the only statement that can be found prior to
Constantine’s Sunday law that has such an appearance,
and the proof is decisive that such was
not its meaning. Here are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We, however (just as we have received), only on the
day of the Lord’s resurrection, ought to guard, not only
against kneeling, but every posture and office of solicitude,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
deferring even our businesses, lest we give any place
to the devil. Similarly, too, in the period of Pentecost;
which period we distinguish by the same solemnity of exultation.”<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He speaks of “deferring even our businesses;”
but this does not necessarily imply anything more
than its postponement during the hours devoted
to religious services. It falls very far short of
saying that labor on Sunday is a sin. But we
will quote Tertullian’s next mention of Sunday
observance before noticing further the words last
quoted. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We count fasting or kneeling in worship on the Lord’s
day to be unlawful. We rejoice in the same privilege
also from Easter to Whitsunday.”<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These two things, fasting and kneeling, are the
only acts which the fathers set down as unlawful
on Sunday, unless, indeed, mourning may be included
by some in the list. It is certain that labor
is never thus mentioned. And observe that
Tertullian repeats the important statement of the
previous quotation that the honor due to Sunday
pertains also to the “period of Pentecost,” that is,
to the fifty days between Easter or Passover and
Whitsunday or Pentecost. If, therefore, labor on
Sunday was in Tertullian’s estimation sinful, the
same was true for the period of Pentecost, a space
of fifty days! But this is not possible. We can
conceive of the deferral of business for one religious
assembly each day for fifty days, and also
that men should neither fast nor kneel during
that time, which was precisely what the religious
celebration of Sunday actually was. But to
make Tertullian assert that labor on Sunday
was a sin is to make him declare that such was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
the case for fifty days together, which no one will
venture to say was the doctrine of Tertullian.</p>

<p>In another work Tertullian gives us one more
statement respecting the nature of Sunday observance:
“We make Sunday a day of festivity.
What then? Do you do less than this?”<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> His
language is very extraordinary when it is considered
that he was addressing heathen. It
seems that Sunday as a Christian festival was so
similar to the festival which these heathen observed
that he could challenge them to show
wherein the Christians went further than did
these heathen whom he here addressed.</p>

<p>The next father who gives us the nature of
early Sunday observance is Peter of Alexandria.
He says: “But the Lord’s day we celebrate as a
day of joy, because on it he rose again, on which
day we have received it for a custom not even
to bow the knee.”<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> He marks two things essential.
It must be a day of joy, and Christians
must not kneel on that day. Zonaras, an ancient
commentator on these words of Peter, explains
the day of joy by saying, “We ought not to fast;
for it is a day of joy for the resurrection of the
Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Next in order, we quote the so-called
Apostolical Constitutions. These command Christians
to assemble for worship every day, “but
principally on the Sabbath day. And on the
day of our Lord’s resurrection, which is the
Lord’s day, meet more diligently, sending praise
to God,” etc. The object of assembling was “to
hear the saving word concerning the resurrection,”
to “pray thrice standing,” to have the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
prophets read, to have preaching and also the
supper.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> These “Constitutions” not only give
the nature of the worship on Sunday as just set
forth, but they also give us an idea of Sunday as
a day of festivity:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now we exhort you, brethren and fellow-servants, to
avoid vain talk and obscene discourses, and jestings,
drunkenness, lasciviousness, luxury, unbounded passions,
with foolish discourses, <i>since we do not permit you so much
as on the Lord’s days</i>, which are days of joy, to speak or
act anything unseemly.”<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This language plainly implies that the so-called
Lord’s day was a day of greater mirth than the
other days of the week. Even on the Lord’s day
they must not speak or act anything unseemly,
though it is evident that their license on that
day was greater than on other days. Once more
these “Constitutions” give us the nature of Sunday
observance: “Every Sabbath day excepting
one, and every Lord’s day hold your solemn assemblies,
and rejoice; for he will be guilty of
sin who fasts on the Lord’s day.”<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> But no one
can read so much as once that “he is guilty of
sin who performs work on this day.”</p>

<p>Next, we quote the epistle to the Magnesians
in its longer form, which though not written by
Ignatius was actually written about the time that
the Apostolical Constitutions were committed to
writing. Here are the words of this epistle:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every
friend of Christ keep the Lord’s day as a festival, the resurrection
day, the queen and chief of all the days.”<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The writer of the Syriac Documents concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
Edessa comes last, and he defines the services
of Sunday as follows: “On the first [day] of
the week, let there be service, and the reading of
the Holy Scriptures, and the oblation.”<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> These
are all the passages in the writings of the first
three centuries which describe early first-day observance.
Let the reader judge whether we have
correctly stated the nature of that observance.
Next we invite attention to the several reasons
offered by these fathers for celebrating the festival
of Sunday.</p>

<p>The reputed epistle of Barnabas supports the
Sunday festival by saying that it was the day
“on which Jesus rose again from the dead,” and
it intimates that it prefigures the eighth thousand
years, when God shall create the world anew.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>Justin Martyr has four reasons:—</p>

<p>1. “It is the first day on which God having
wrought a change in the darkness and matter,
made the world.”<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>2. “Jesus Christ our Saviour on the same day
rose from the dead.”<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>3. “It is possible for us to show how the eighth
day possessed a certain mysterious import, which
the seventh day did not possess, and which was
promulgated by God through these rites,”<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> <i>i. e.</i>,
through circumcision.</p>

<p>4. “The command of circumcision, again, bidding
[them] always circumcise the children on
the eighth day, was a type of the true circumcision,
by which we are circumcised from deceit
and iniquity through Him who rose from the
dead on the first day after the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>Clement, of Alexandria, appears to treat solely
of a mystical eighth day or Lord’s day. It is
perhaps possible that he has some reference to
Sunday. We therefore quote what he says in
behalf of this day, calling attention to the fact
that he produces his testimony, not from the Bible,
but from a heathen philosopher. Thus he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the Lord’s day Plato prophetically speaks of in
the tenth book of the <i>Republic</i>, in these words: ‘And
when seven days have passed to each of them in the
meadow on the eighth day they are to set out and arrive
in four days.’”<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Clement’s reasons for Sunday are found outside
the Scriptures. The next father will give us a
good reason for Clement’s action in this case.</p>

<p>Tertullian is the next writer who gives reasons
for the Sunday festival. He is speaking of “offerings
for the dead,” the manner of Sunday observance,
and the use of the sign of the cross
upon the forehead. Here is the ground on which
these observances rest:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If, for these and other such rules, you insist upon having
positive Scripture injunction, you will find none.
Tradition will be held forth to you as the originator of
them, custom, as their strengthener, and faith, as their
observer. That reason will support tradition, and custom,
and faith, you will either yourself perceive, or learn
from some one who has.”<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian’s frankness is to be commended.
He had no Scripture to offer, and he acknowledges
the fact. He depended on tradition, and
he was not ashamed to confess it. The next of
the fathers who gives Scripture evidence in support<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
of the Sunday festival, is Origen. Here are
his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The manna fell on the Lord’s day, and not on the
Sabbath to show the Jews that even then the Lord’s day
was preferred before it.”<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Origen seems to have been of Tertullian’s judgment
as to the inconclusiveness of the arguments
adduced by his predecessors. He therefore coined
an original argument which seems to have been
very conclusive in his estimation as he offers this
alone. But he must have forgotten that the
manna fell on all the six working days, or he
would have seen that while his argument does
not elevate Sunday above the other five working
days, it does make the Sabbath the least reputable
day of the seven! And yet the miracle of
the manna was expressly designed to set forth
the sacredness of the Sabbath and to establish its
authority before the people. Cyprian is the
next father who gives an argument for the Sunday
festival. He contents himself with one of
Justin’s old arguments, viz., that one drawn from
circumcision. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For in respect of the observance of the eighth day in
the Jewish circumcision of the flesh, a sacrament was
given beforehand in shadow and in usage; but when
Christ came, it was fulfilled in truth. For because the
eighth day, that is, the first day after the Sabbath, was to
be that on which the Lord should rise again, and should
quicken us, and give us circumcision of the Spirit, the
eighth day, that is, the first day after the Sabbath, and the
Lord’s day, went before in the figure; which figure ceased
when by and by the truth came, and spiritual circumcision
was given to us.”<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>Such is the only argument adduced by Cyprian
in behalf of the first-day festival. The
circumcision of infants when eight days old was,
in his judgment, a type of infant baptism. But
circumcision on the eighth day of the child’s life,
in his estimation, did not signify that baptism
need to be deferred till the infant is eight days
old, but, as here stated, did signify that the eighth
day was to be the Lord’s day! But the eighth
day, on which circumcision took place, was not
the first day of the week, but the eighth day of
each child’s life, whatever day of the week that
might be.</p>

<p>The next father who gives a reason for celebrating
Sunday as a day of joy, and refraining
from kneeling on it, is Peter of Alexandria, who
simply says, “Because on it he rose again.”<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>Next in order come the Apostolical Constitutions,
which assert that the Sunday festival is a
memorial of the resurrection:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But keep the Sabbath, and the Lord’s day festival;
because the former is a memorial of the creation, and the
latter of the resurrection.”<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The writer, however, offers no proof that Sunday
was set apart by divine authority in memory
of the resurrection. But the next person who
gives his reasons for keeping Sunday “as a festival”
is the writer of the longer form of the reputed
epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians. He
finds the eighth day prophetically set forth in
the title to the sixth and twelfth psalms! In
the margin, the word Sheminith is translated
“the eighth.” Here is this writer’s argument for
Sunday:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Looking forward to this, the prophet declared, ‘To
the end for the eighth day,’ on which our life both sprang
up again, and the victory over death was obtained in
Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is yet another of the fathers of the first
three centuries who gives the reasons then used
in support of the Sunday festival. This is the
writer of the Syriac Documents concerning
Edessa. He comes next in order and closes the
list. Here are four reasons:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. “Because on the first day of the week our Lord
rose from the place of the dead.”<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>2. “On the first day of the week he arose upon the
world,”<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> <i>i. e.</i>, he was born upon Sunday.</p>

<p>3. “On the first day of the week he ascended up to
Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>4. “On the first day of the week he will appear at last
with the angels of Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The first of these reasons is as good a one as
man can devise out of his own heart for doing
what God never commanded; the second and
fourth are mere assertions of which mankind
know nothing; while the third is a positive untruth,
for the ascension was upon Thursday.</p>

<p>We have now presented every reason for the
Sunday festival which can be found in all the
writings of the first three centuries. Though
generally very trivial, and sometimes worse than
trivial, they are nevertheless worthy of careful
study. They constitute a decisive testimony that
the change of the Sabbath by Christ or by his
apostles from the seventh to the first day of the
week was absolutely unknown during that entire
period. But were it true that such change had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
been made they must have known it. Had they
believed that Christ changed the Sabbath to
commemorate his resurrection, how emphatically
would they have stated that fact instead of offering
reasons for the festival of Sunday which are
so worthless as to be, with one or two exceptions,
entirely discarded by modern first-day writers.
Or had they believed that the apostles honored
Sunday as the Sabbath or Lord’s day, how would
they have produced these facts in triumph! But
Tertullian said that they had no positive Scripture
injunction for the Sunday festival, and the others,
by offering reasons that were only devised in
their own hearts, corroborated his testimony, and
all of them together establish the fact that even
in their own estimation the day was only sustained
by the authority of the church. They
were totally unacquainted with the modern doctrine
that the seventh day in the commandment
means simply one day in seven, and that the
Saviour, to commemorate his resurrection, appointed
that the first day of the week should be
that one of the seven to which the commandment
should apply!</p>

<p>We have given every statement in the fathers
of the first three centuries in which the manner
of celebrating the Sunday festival is set forth.
We have also given every reason for that observance
which is to be found in any of them. These
two classes of testimonies show clearly that ordinary
labor was not one of the things which were
forbidden on that day. We now offer direct
proof that other days which on all hands are accounted
nothing but church festivals were expressly
declared by the fathers to be equal if not
superior in sacredness to the Sunday festival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>The “Lost Writings of Irenæus” gives us his
mind concerning the relative sacredness of the
festival of Sunday and that of either Easter or
Pentecost. This is the statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon which [feast] we do not bend the knee, because
it is of <i>equal significance</i> with the Lord’s day, for the reason
already alleged concerning it.”<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian in a passage already quoted, which
by omitting the sentence we are about to quote,
has been used as the strongest testimony to the
first-day Sabbath in the fathers, expressly equals
in sacredness the period of Pentecost—a space of
fifty days—with the festival which he calls Lord’s
day. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Similarly, too, in the period of Pentecost; which
period we distinguish by <i>the same solemnity of exultation</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He states the same fact in another work:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We count fasting or kneeling in worship on the Lord’s
day to be unlawful. We rejoice <i>in the same privilege</i> also
from Easter to Whitsunday.”<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Origen classes the so-called Lord’s day with
three other church festivals:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If it be objected to us on this subject that we ourselves
are accustomed to observe certain days, as for example
the Lord’s day, the Preparation, the Passover, or
Pentecost, I have to answer, that to the perfect Christian,
who is ever in his thoughts, words, and deeds, serving
his natural Lord, God the Word, all his days are the
Lord’s, and he is always keeping the Lord’s day.”<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Irenæus and Tertullian make the Sunday
Lord’s day equal in sacredness with the period
from the Passover to the Pentecost; but Origen,
after classing the day with several church festivals,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
virtually confesses that it has no pre-eminence
above other days.</p>

<p>Commodianus, who once uses the term Lord’s
day, speaks of the Catholic festival of the Passover
as “Easter, that day of ours <i>most blessed</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
This certainly indicates that in his estimation no
other sacred day was superior in sanctity to
Easter.</p>

<p>The “Apostolical Constitutions” treat the Sunday
festival in the same manner that it is treated
by Irenæus and Tertullian. They make it equal
to the sacredness of the period from Easter to
the Pentecost. Thus they say:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He will be guilty of sin who fasts on the Lord’s day,
being the day of the resurrection, or during the time of
Pentecost, or in general, who is sad on a festival day to
the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These testimonies prove conclusively that the
festival of Sunday, in the judgment of such men
as Irenæus, Tertullian, and others, stood in the
same rank with that of Easter, or Whitsunday.
They had no idea that one was commanded by
God, while the others were only ordained by the
church. Indeed, Tertullian, as we have seen,
expressly declares that there is no precept for
Sunday observance.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>Besides these important facts, we have decisive
evidence that Sunday was not a day of abstinence
from labor, and our first witness is Justin, the
earliest witness to the Sunday festival in the
Christian church. Trypho the Jew said to Justin,
by way of reproof, “You observe no festivals
or Sabbaths.”<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> This was exactly adapted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
bring out from Justin the statement that, though
he did not observe the seventh day as the Sabbath,
he did thus rest on the first day of the
week, if it were true that that day was with him
a day of abstinence from labor. But he gives no
such answer. He sneers at the very idea of abstinence
from labor, declaring that “God does not
take pleasure in such observances.” Nor does he
intimate that this is because the Jews did not
rest upon the right day, but he condemns the
very idea of refraining from labor for a day, stating
that “the new law,” which has taken the
place of the commandments given on Sinai<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> requires
a perpetual Sabbath, and this is kept by
repenting of sin and refraining from its commission.
Here are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The new law requires you to keep a perpetual Sabbath,
and you, <i>because you are idle for one day</i>, suppose
you are pious, not discerning why this has been commanded
you; and if you eat unleavened bread, you say
the will of God has been fulfilled. The Lord our God
does not take pleasure in such observances: if there is
any perjured person or a thief among you, let him cease
to be so; if any adulterer, let him repent; then he has
kept the sweet and true Sabbaths of God.”<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This language plainly implies that Justin did
not believe that any day should be kept as a
Sabbath by abstinence from labor, but that all
days should be kept as sabbaths by abstinence
from sin. This testimony is decisive, and it is
in exact harmony with the facts already adduced
from the fathers, and with others yet to be presented.
Moreover, it is confirmed by the express
testimony of Tertullian. He says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By us (to whom <i>Sabbaths are strange</i>, and the new
moons, and festivals formerly beloved by God) the Saturnalia
and new year’s and mid-winter’s festivals and Matronalia
are frequented.”<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And he adds in the same paragraph, in words
already quoted:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If <i>any indulgence is to be granted to the flesh</i>, you have
it. I will not say <i>your own days</i>, but <i>more too</i>; for to
the <i>heathens</i> each festive day occurs but once annually;
you have a <i>festive day every eighth day</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian tells his brethren in plain language
that they kept no sabbaths, but did keep many
heathen festivals. If the Sunday festival, which
was a day of “indulgence” to the flesh, and
which he here mentions as the “eighth day,” was
kept by them as the Christian Sabbath in place
of the ancient seventh day, then he would not
have asserted that to us “sabbaths are strange.”
But Tertullian has precisely the same Sabbath as
Justin Martyr. He does not keep the first day
in place of the seventh, but he keeps a “perpetual
sabbath,” in which he professes to refrain
from sin every day, and actually abstains from
labor on none. Thus, after saying that the Jews
teach that “from the beginning God sanctified
the seventh day” and therefore observe that day,
he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whence we [Christians] understand that we still
more ought to observe a Sabbath from all ‘servile work’
always, and not only every seventh day, but through all
time.”<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian certainly had no idea that Sunday
was the Sabbath in any other sense than were
all the seven days of the week. We shall find a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
decisive confirmation of this when we come to
quote Tertullian respecting the origin of the
Sabbath. We shall also find that Clement expressly
makes Sunday a day of labor.</p>

<p>Several of the early fathers wrote in opposition
to the observance of the seventh day. We now
give the reasons assigned by each for that opposition.
The writer called Barnabas did not keep
the seventh day, not because it was a ceremonial
ordinance unworthy of being observed by a Christian,
but because it was so pure an institution
that even Christians cannot truly sanctify it till
they are made immortal. Here are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Attend, my children, to the meaning of this expression,
‘He finished in six days.’ This implieth that the
Lord will finish all things in six thousand years, for a day
is with him a thousand years. And he himself testifieth,
saying, ‘Behold, to-day will be as a thousand years.’
Therefore, my children, in six days, that is, in six thousand
years, all things will be finished. And he rested
on the seventh day.’ This meaneth: When his Son,
coming [again], shall destroy the time of the wicked man,
and judge the ungodly, and change the sun, and the
moon, and the stars, then shall he truly rest on the seventh
day. Moreover, he says, ‘Thou shalt sanctify it
with pure hands and a pure heart.’ If, therefore, any
one can now sanctify the day which God hath sanctified,
except he is pure in heart in all things, we are deceived.
Behold, therefore: certainly then one properly resting
sanctifies it, when we ourselves, having received the
promise, wickedness no longer existing, and all things
having been made new by the Lord, shall be able to work
righteousness. Then we shall be able to sanctify it, having
been first sanctified ourselves. Further he says to
them, ‘Your new moons and your sabbaths I cannot endure.’
Ye perceive how he speaks: Your present sabbaths
are not acceptable to me, but that is which I have
made [namely this], when, giving rest to all things, I
shall make a beginning of the eighth day, that is, a beginning
of another world, wherefore, also, we keep the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
eighth day with joyfulness, the day, also, on which Jesus
rose again from the dead.”<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Observe the points embodied in this statement
of doctrine: 1. He asserts that the six days of
creation prefigure the six thousand years which
our world shall endure in its present state of
wickedness. 2. He teaches that at the end of
that period Christ shall come again and make an
end of wickedness, and “then shall he truly rest
on the seventh day.” 3. That no “one can now
sanctify the day which God hath sanctified, except
he is pure in heart in all things.” 4. But
that cannot be the case until the present world
shall pass away, “when we ourselves, having received
the promise, wickedness no longer existing,
and all things having been made new by the
Lord, shall be able to work righteousness. Then
we shall be able to sanctify it, having been first
sanctified ourselves.” Men cannot, therefore,
keep the Sabbath while this wicked world lasts.
5. Therefore, he says, “Your present sabbaths
are not acceptable,” not because they are not
pure, but because you are not now able to keep
them as purely as their nature demands. 6.
That is to say, the keeping of the day which
God has sanctified is not possible in such a
wicked world as this. 7. But though the seventh
day cannot now be kept, the eighth day
can be, and ought to be, because when the seven
thousand years are past, there will be at the beginning
of the eighth thousand, the new creation.
8. Therefore, he did not attempt to keep the seventh
day, which God had sanctified; for that is
too pure to be kept in the present wicked world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
and can only be kept after the Saviour comes at
the commencement of the seventh thousand
years; but he kept the eighth day with joyfulness
on which Jesus arose from the dead. 9. So
it appears that the eighth day, which God never
sanctified, is exactly suitable for observance in
our world during its present state of wickedness.
10. But when all things have been made new,
and we are able to work righteousness, and wickedness
no longer exists, then we shall be able to
sanctify the seventh day, having first been sanctified
ourselves.</p>

<p>The reason of Barnabas for not observing the
Sabbath of the Lord is not that the commandment
enjoining it is abolished, but that the institution
is so pure that men in their present imperfect
state cannot acceptably sanctify it. They
will keep it, however, in the new creation, but in
the meantime they keep with joyfulness the
eighth day, which having never been sanctified
by God is not difficult to keep in the present
state of wickedness.</p>

<p>Justin Martyr’s reasons for not observing the
Sabbath are not at all like those of the so-called
Barnabas, for Justin seems to have heartily despised
the Sabbatic institution. He denies that
it was obligatory before the time of Moses, and affirms
that it was abolished by the advent of
Christ. He teaches that it was given to the Jews
because of their wickedness, and he expressly affirms
the abolition of both the Sabbath and the
law. So far is he from teaching the change of
the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of
the week, or from making the Sunday festival a
continuation of the ancient Sabbatic institution,
that he sneers at the very idea of days of abstinence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
from labor, or days of idleness, and though
God gives as his reason for the observance of the
Sabbath, that that was the day on which he
rested from all his work, Justin gives as his first
reason for the Sunday festival that that was the
day on which God began his work! Of abstinence
from labor as an act of obedience to the
Sabbath, Justin says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Lord our God does not take pleasure in such observances.”<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A second reason for not observing the Sabbath
is thus stated by him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For we too would observe the fleshly circumcision,
and the Sabbaths, and in short, all the feasts, if we did
not know for what reason they were enjoined you—namely,
on account of your transgressions and the hardness of
your hearts.”<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As Justin never discriminates between the
Sabbath of the Lord and the annual sabbaths he
doubtless here means to include it as well as them.
But what a falsehood is it to assert that the Sabbath
was given to the Jews because of their
wickedness! The truth is, it was given to the
Jews because of the universal apostasy of the
Gentiles.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> But in the following paragraph Justin
gives three more reasons for not keeping the
Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Do you see that the elements are not idle, and keep
no Sabbaths? Remain as you were born. For if there
was no need of circumcision before Abraham, or of the
observance of Sabbaths, of feasts and sacrifices, before
Moses; no more need is there of them now, after that,
according to the will of God, Jesus Christ the Son of God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
has been born without sin, of a virgin sprung from the
stock of Abraham.”<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here are three reasons: 1. “That the elements
are not idle, and keep no Sabbaths.” Though
this reason is simply worthless as an argument
against the seventh day, it is a decisive confirmation
of the fact already proven, that Justin did
not make Sunday a day of abstinence from labor.
2. His second reason here given is that there was
no observance of Sabbaths before Moses, and yet
we do know that God at the beginning did appoint
the Sabbath to a holy use, a fact to which
as we shall see quite a number of the fathers testify,
and we also know that in that age were men
who kept all the precepts of God. 3. There is
no need of Sabbatic observance since Christ.
Though this is mere assertion, it is by no means
easy for those to meet it fairly who represent
Justin as maintaining the Christian Sabbath.</p>

<p>Another argument by Justin against the obligation
of the Sabbath is that God “directs the
government of the universe on this day equally
as on all others!”<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> as though this were inconsistent
with the present sacredness of the Sabbath,
when it is also true that God thus governed the
world in the period when Justin acknowledges
the Sabbath to have been obligatory. Though
this reason is trivial as an argument against the
Sabbath, it does show that Justin could have
attached no Sabbatic character to Sunday. But
he has yet one more argument against the Sabbath.
The ancient law has been done away by
the new and final law, and the old covenant has
been superseded by the new.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> But he forgets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
that the design of the new covenant was not to
do away with the law of God, but to put that
law into the heart of every Christian. And many
of the fathers, as we shall see, expressly repudiate
this doctrine of the abrogation of the Decalogue.</p>

<p>Such were Justin’s reasons for rejecting the
ancient Sabbath. But though he was a decided
asserter of the abrogation of the law, and of the
Sabbatic institution itself, and kept Sunday only
as a festival, modern first-day writers cite him
as a witness in support of the doctrine that the
first day of the week should be observed as the
Christian Sabbath on the authority of the fourth
commandment.</p>

<p>Now let us learn what stood in the way of
Irenæus’ observance of the Sabbath. It was not
that the commandments were abolished, for we
shall presently learn that he taught their perpetuity.
Nor was it that he believed in the change
of the Sabbath, for he gives no hint of such an
idea. The Sunday festival in his estimation appears
to have been simply of “equal significance”
with the Pentecost.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> Nor was it that Christ
broke the Sabbath, for Irenæus says that he did
not.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> But because the Sabbath is called a sign
he regarded it as significant of the future kingdom,
and appears to have considered it no longer
obligatory, though he does not expressly say
this. Thus he sets forth the meaning of the Sabbath
as held by him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Moreover the Sabbaths of God, <i>that is, the kingdom</i>,
was, as it were, indicated by created things,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These [promises to the righteous] are [to take place]
in <i>the times of the kingdom</i>, that is, upon the seventh day
which has been sanctified, in which God rested from all
the works which he created, which is the true Sabbath of
the righteous,”<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> etc.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the day of the Lord is as a thousand years: and
in six days created things were completed: it is evident,
therefore, that they will come to an end at the sixth thousand
year.”<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But Irenæus did not notice that the Sabbath
as a sign does not point forward to the restitution,
but backward to the creation, that it may signify
that the true God is the Creator.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> Nor did he
observe the fact that when the kingdom of God
shall be established under the whole heaven all
flesh shall hallow the Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>But he says that those who lived before Moses
were justified “without observance of Sabbaths,”
and offers as proof that the covenant at Horeb
was not made with the fathers. Of course if this
proves that the patriarchs were free from obligation
toward the fourth commandment, it is equally
good as proof that they might violate any
other. These things indicate that Irenæus was
opposed to Sabbatic observance, though he did
not in express language assert its abrogation, and
did in most decisive terms assert the continued
obligation of the ten commandments.</p>

<p>Tertullian offers numerous reasons for not observing
the Sabbath, but there is scarcely one of
these that he does not in some other place expressly
contradict. Thus he asserts that the patriarchs
before Moses did not observe the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> But he offers no proof, and he elsewhere
dates the origin of the Sabbath at the creation,<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
as we shall show hereafter. In several places he
teaches the abrogation of the law, and seems to
set aside moral law as well as ceremonial. But
elsewhere, as we shall show, he bears express
testimony that the ten commandments are still
binding as the rule of the Christian’s life.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> He
quotes the words of Isaiah in which God is represented
as hating the feasts, new-moons, and
sabbaths observed by the Jews,<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> as proof that
the seventh-day Sabbath was a temporary institution
which Christ abrogated. But in another
place he says: “<i>Christ did not at all rescind the
Sabbath</i>: he kept the law thereof.”<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> And he also
explains this very text by stating that God’s aversion
toward the Sabbaths observed by the Jews
was “because they were celebrated without the
fear of God by a people full of iniquities,” and
adds that the prophet, in a later passage speaking
of Sabbaths celebrated according to God’s commandment,
“declares them to be true, delightful,
and inviolable.”<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> Another statement is that
Joshua violated the Sabbath in the siege of Jericho.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
Yet he elsewhere explains this very case,
showing that the commandment forbids our own
work, not God’s. Those who acted at Jericho did
“not do their own work, but God’s, which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
executed, and that, too, from his express commandment.”<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
He also both asserts and denies
that Christ violated the Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> Tertullian
was a double-minded man. He wrote much
against the law and the Sabbath, but he also
contradicted and exposed his own errors.</p>

<p>Origen attempts to prove that the ancient Sabbath
is to be understood mystically or spiritually,
and not literally. Here is his argument:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Ye shall sit, every one in your dwellings: no one
shall move from his place on the Sabbath day.’ Which
precept it is impossible to observe literally; for no man
can sit a whole day so as not to move from the place
where he sat down.”<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Great men are not always wise. There is no
such precept in the Bible. Origen referred to
that which forbade the people to go out for manna
on the Sabbath, but which did not conflict
with another that commanded holy convocations
or assemblies for worship on the Sabbath.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p>Victorinus is the latest of the fathers before
Constantine who offers reasons against the observance
of the Sabbath. His first reason is that
Christ said by Isaiah that his soul hated the Sabbath;
which Sabbath he in his body abolished;
and these assertions we have seen answered by
Tertullian.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> His second reason is that “Jesus
[Joshua] the son of Nave [Nun], the successor of
Moses, himself broke the Sabbath day,”<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> which
is false. His third reason is that “Matthias [a
Maccabean] also, prince of Judah, broke the
Sabbath,”<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> which is doubtless false, but is of no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
consequence as authority. His fourth argument
is original, and may fitly close the list of reasons
assigned in the early fathers for not observing
the Sabbath. It is given in full without an answer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And in Matthew we read, that it is written Isaiah also
and the rest of his colleagues broke the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SABBATH IN THE RECORD OF THE EARLY FATHERS.</span></h3>

<p>The first reasons for neglecting the Sabbath are now mostly
obsolete—A portion of the early fathers taught the perpetuity
of the decalogue, and made it the standard of moral
character—What they say concerning the origin of the
Sabbath at Creation—Their testimony concerning the perpetuity
of the ancient Sabbath, and concerning its observance—Enumeration
of the things which caused the suppression
of the Sabbath and the elevation of Sunday.</p>

</div>

<p>The reasons offered by the early fathers for
neglecting the observance of the Sabbath show
conclusively that they had no special light on the
subject by reason of living in the first centuries,
which we in this later age do not possess. The
fact is, so many of the reasons offered by them
are manifestly false and absurd that those who
in these days discard the Sabbath, do also discard
the most of the reasons offered by these
fathers for this same course. We have also
learned from such of the early fathers as mention
first-day observance, the exact nature of the Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
festival, and all the reasons which in the first
centuries were offered in its support. Very few
indeed of these reasons are now offered by modern
first-day writers.</p>

<p>But some of the fathers bear emphatic testimony
to the perpetuity of the ten commandments,
and make their observance the condition
of eternal life. Some of them also distinctly assert
the origin of the Sabbath at creation. Several
of them moreover either bear witness to the
existence of Sabbath-keepers, or bear decisive
testimony to the perpetuity and obligation of the
Sabbath, or define the nature of proper Sabbatic
observance, or connect the observance of the Sabbath
and first day together. Let us now hear
the testimony of those who assert the authority
of the ten commandments. Irenæus asserts their
perpetuity, and makes them a test of Christian
character. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For God at the first, indeed, warning them [the Jews]
by means of <i>natural precepts</i>, which <i>from the beginning he
had implanted in mankind</i>, that is, by means of <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Decalogue</span>
(<i>which, if any one does not observe, he has no salvation</i>),
did then demand nothing more of them.”<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is a very strong statement. He makes
the ten commandments the law of nature implanted
in man’s being at the beginning; and so inherited
by all mankind. This is no doubt true.
It is the presence of the carnal mind or law of
sin and death, implanted in man by the fall, that
has partially obliterated this law, and made the
work of the new covenant a necessity.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> He again
asserts the perpetuity and authority of the ten
commandments:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Preparing man for this life, the Lord himself did
speak in his own person to all alike the words of the Decalogue:
and therefore, in like manner, do they remain
permanently with us, receiving, by means of his advent in
the flesh, extension and increase, but not abrogation.”<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

</div>

<p>By the “extension” of the decalogue, Irenæus
doubtless means the exposition which the Saviour
gave of the meaning of the commandments in his
sermon on the mount.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Theophilus speaks in
like manner concerning the decalogue:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For God has given us a law and holy commandments;
and <i>every one</i> who <i>keeps</i> these <i>can be saved</i>, and, obtaining
the resurrection, can inherit incorruption.”<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have learned a holy law; but we have as Law-giver
him who is really God, who teaches us to act righteously,
and to be pious, and to do good.”<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of this great and wonderful law which tends to all
righteousness, the <span class="smcap">ten heads</span> are such as we have already
rehearsed.”<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian calls the ten commandments “the
rules of our regenerate life,” that is to say, the
rules which govern the life of a converted man:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They who theorize respecting numbers, honor the
number ten as the parent of all the others, and as imparting
perfection to the human nativity. For my own part, I
prefer viewing this measure of time in reference to God,
as if implying that the ten months rather initiated man
into <i>the ten commandments</i>; so that the numerical estimate
of the time needed to consummate our natural birth should
correspond to the numerical classification of <i>the rules of
our regenerate life</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In showing the deep guilt involved in the violation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
of the seventh commandment, Tertullian
speaks of the sacredness of the commandments
which precede it, naming several of them in particular,
and among them the fourth, and then
says of the precept against adultery that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It stands “in the very forefront of <i>the most holy law</i>,
among the <i>primary counts</i> of the <i>celestial edict</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Clement of Rome, or rather the author whose
works have been ascribed to this father, speaks
thus of the decalogue as a test:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On account of those, therefore, who, by neglect of
their own salvation, please the evil one, and those who,
by study of their own profit, seek to please the good One,
ten things have been prescribed as a test to this present
age, according to the number of the ten plagues which
were brought upon Egypt.”<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Novatian, who wrote about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 250, is accounted
the founder of the sect called <i>Cathari</i> or
Puritans. He wrote a treatise on the Sabbath,
which is not extant. There is no reference to
Sunday in any of his writings. He makes the
following striking remarks concerning the moral
law:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The law was given to the children of Israel for this
purpose, that they might profit by it, and <span class="smcap">return</span> <i>to
those virtuous manners</i> which, although <i>they had received
them from their fathers</i>, they had corrupted in Egypt
by reason of their intercourse with a barbarous people.
Finally, also, those <i>ten commandments</i> on the tables teach
nothing <i>new</i>, but <i>remind them of what had been obliterated</i>—that
righteousness in them, which had been put to sleep,
might revive again as it were by the afflatus of the law,
after the manner of a fire [nearly extinguished].”<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is evident that in the judgment of Novatian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
the ten commandments enjoined nothing that
was not sacredly regarded by the patriarchs before
Jacob went down into Egypt. It follows,
therefore, that, in his opinion, the Sabbath was
made, not at the fall of the manna, but when God
sanctified the seventh day, and that holy men
from the earliest ages observed it.</p>

<p>The Apostolical Constitutions, written about
the third century, give us an understanding of
what was widely regarded in the third century
as apostolic doctrine. They speak thus of the
ten commandments:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Have before thine eyes the fear of God, and always
remember the ten commandments of God,—to love the
one and only Lord God with all thy strength; to give no
heed to idols, or any other beings, as being lifeless gods,
or irrational beings or dæmons.”<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He gave a plain law to assist the law of nature, such
a one as is pure, saving, and holy, in which his own name
was inscribed, perfect, which is never to fail, being complete
in ten commands, unspotted, converting souls.”<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This writer, like Irenæus, believed in the identity
of the decalogue with the law of nature.
These testimonies show that in the writings of
the early fathers are some of the strongest utterances
in behalf of the perpetuity and authority
of the ten commandments. Now let us hear
what they say concerning the origin of the Sabbath
at creation. The epistle ascribed to Barnabas,
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And he says in another place, ‘If my sons keep the
Sabbath, then will I cause my mercy to rest upon them.’
The Sabbath is mentioned at the beginning of the creation
[thus]: ‘And God made in six days the works of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
hands, and made an end on the seventh day, and rested
on it, and sanctified it.’”<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Irenæus seems plainly to connect the origin of
the Sabbath with the sanctification of the seventh
day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These [things promised] are [to take place] in the
times of the kingdom, that is, upon the seventh day,
which has been sanctified, in which God rested from all
his works which he created, which is the true Sabbath, in
which they shall not be engaged in any earthly occupation.”<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tertullian, likewise, refers the origin of the
Sabbath to “the benediction of the Father”:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But inasmuch as birth is also completed with the
seventh month, I more readily recognize in this number
than in the eighth the honor of a numerical agreement
with the Sabbatical period; so that the month in which
God’s image is sometimes produced in a human birth,
shall in its number tally with the day on which God’s
creation was completed and <i>hallowed</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For even in the case before us he [Christ] fulfilled
the law, while interpreting its condition; [moreover] he
exhibits in a clear light the different kinds of work, while
doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the
Sabbath, [and] while imparting to the Sabbath day itself
which <i>from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction
of the Father</i>, an additional sanctity by his own
beneficent action.”<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Origen, who, as we have seen, believed in a
mystical Sabbath, did nevertheless fix its origin
at the sanctification of the seventh day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For he [Celsus] knows nothing of the day of the Sabbath
and rest of God, which follows the completion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
world’s creation, and which lasts during the duration of
the world, and in which all those will keep festival with
God who have done all their works in their six days.”<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The testimony of Novatian which has been
given relative to the sacredness and authority of
the decalogue plainly implies the existence of the
Sabbath in the patriarchal ages, and its observance
by those holy men of old. It was given to
Israel that they might “<span class="smcap">return</span> to those <i>virtuous
manners</i> which, although <i>they had received
them from their fathers</i>, they had corrupted in
Egypt.” And he adds, “Those ten commandments
on the tables teach <i>nothing new</i>, but <i>remind</i>
them of what had been obliterated.”<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> He
did not, therefore, believe the Sabbath to have
originated at the fall of the manna, but counted
it one of those things which were practiced by
their fathers before Jacob went down to Egypt.</p>

<p>Lactantius places the origin of the Sabbath at
creation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“God completed the world and this admirable work of
nature in the space of six days (as is contained in the
secrets of holy Scripture) and <span class="smcap">consecrated</span> the seventh
day on which he had rested from his works. But this is
the Sabbath day, which, in the language of the Hebrews,
received its name from the number, whence the seventh is
the legitimate and complete number.”<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In a poem on Genesis written about the time
of Lactantius, but by an unknown author, we have
an explicit testimony to the divine appointment
of the seventh day to a holy use while man was
yet in Eden, the garden of God:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The seventh came, when God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At his work’s end did rest, <span class="smcap">decreeing it</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">Sacred unto the coming age’s joys</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Apostolical Constitutions, while teaching
the present obligation of the Sabbath, plainly indicate
its origin to have been at creation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“O Lord Almighty, thou hast created the world by
Christ, and <i>hast appointed the Sabbath in memory thereof</i>,
because that on that day thou hast made us rest from our
works, for the meditation upon thy laws.”<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such are the testimonies of the early fathers
to the primeval origin of the Sabbath, and to the
sacredness and perpetual obligation of the ten
commandments. We now call attention to what
they say relative to the perpetuity of the Sabbath,
and to its observance in the centuries during
which they lived. Tertullian defines Christ’s
relation to the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He was called ‘Lord of the Sabbath’ because he
maintained the Sabbath as his own institution.”<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He affirms that Christ did not abolish the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: he kept the
law thereof, and both in the former case did a work
which was beneficial to the life of his disciples (for he indulged
them with the relief of food when they were hungry),
and in the present instance cured the withered
hand; in each case intimating by facts, ‘I came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfill it.’”<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor can it be said that while Tertullian denied
that Christ abolished the Sabbath he did believe
that he transferred its sacredness from the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
day of the week to the first, for he continues
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He [Christ] exhibits in a clear light the different
kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the
sacredness of the Sabbath, [and] while imparting to the
Sabbath day itself, which from the beginning had been
consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional
sanctity by his own beneficent action. For he furnished
<i>to this day</i> <span class="smcap">divine safeguards</span>—<i>a course which his
adversary would have pursued for some other days</i>, to avoid
honoring the Creator’s Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath
the works which were proper for it.”<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is a very remarkable statement. The
modern doctrine of the change of the Sabbath
was unknown in Tertullian’s time. Had it then
been in existence, there could be no doubt that in
the words last quoted he was aiming at it a heavy
blow; for the very thing which he asserts Christ’s
adversary, Satan, would have had him do, that
modern first-day writers assert he did do in consecrating
another day instead of adding to the sanctity
of his Father’s Sabbath.</p>

<p>Archelaus of Cascar in Mesopotamia emphatically
denies the abolition of the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Again, as to the assertion that the Sabbath has been
abolished, we deny that he has abolished it plainly; for
he was himself also Lord of the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Justin Martyr, as we have seen, was an out-spoken
opponent of Sabbatic observance, and of
the authority of the law of God. He was by no
means always candid in what he said. He has
occasion to refer to those who observed the seventh
day, and he does it with contempt. Thus
he says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But if some, through weak-mindedness, wish to observe
such institutions as were given by Moses (from
which they expect some virtue, but which we believe
were appointed by reason of the hardness of the people’s
hearts), along with their hope in this Christ, and [wish to
perform] the eternal and natural acts of righteousness
and piety, yet choose to live with the Christians and the
faithful, as I said before, not inducing them either to be
circumcised like themselves, or to keep the Sabbath, or
to observe any other such ceremonies, then I hold that
we ought to join ourselves to such, and associate with
them in all things as kinsmen and brethren.”<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These words are spoken of Sabbath-keeping
Christians. Such of them as were of Jewish descent
no doubt generally retained circumcision.
But there were many Gentile Christians who observed
the Sabbath, as we shall see, and it is not
true that they observed circumcision. Justin
speaks of this class as acting from “weak-mindedness,”
yet he inadvertently alludes to the keeping
of the commandments as the performance of
“the <span class="smcap">eternal</span> and <span class="smcap">natural acts of righteousness</span>,”
a most appropriate designation indeed.
Justin would fellowship those who act thus, provided
they would fellowship him in the contrary
course. But though Justin, on this condition,
could fellowship these “weak-minded” brethren,
he says that there are those who “<i>do not venture
to have any intercourse with, or to extend hospitality
to, such persons</i>; but I do not agree with
them.”<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> This shows the bitter spirit which prevailed
in some quarters toward the Sabbath,
even as early as Justin’s time. Justin has
no word of condemnation for these intolerant
professors; he is only solicitous lest those persons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
who perform “the eternal and natural acts
of righteousness and piety” should condemn
those who do not perform them.</p>

<p>Clement of Alexandria, though a mystical
writer, bears an important testimony to the perpetuity
of the ancient Sabbath, and to man’s
present need thereof. He comments thus on the
fourth commandment:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And the fourth word is that which intimates that the
world was created by God, and that <i>he gave us the seventh
day as a rest</i>, on account of the trouble that there is in
life. For God is incapable of weariness, and suffering,
and want. <i>But we who bear flesh need rest.</i> The seventh
day, therefore, is proclaimed a rest—abstraction from ills—preparing
for the primal day, our true rest.”<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Clement recognized the authority of the moral
law; for he treats of the ten commandments, one
by one, and shows what each enjoins. He plainly
teaches that the Sabbath was made for man,
and that he now needs it as a day of rest, and
his language implies that it was made at the
creation. But in the next paragraph, he makes
some curious suggestions, which deserve notice:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having reached this point, we must mention these
things by the way; since the discourse has turned on the
seventh and the eighth. For the eighth may possibly
turn out to be properly the seventh, and the seventh
manifestly the sixth, and the latter properly the Sabbath,
and the seventh a day of work. For the creation of the
world was concluded in six days.”<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This language has been adduced to show that
Clement called the eighth day, or Sunday, the
Sabbath. But first-day writers in general have
not dared to commit themselves to such an interpretation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
and some of them have expressly
discarded it. Let us notice this statement with
especial care. He speaks of the ordinals seventh
and eighth in the abstract, but probably with reference
to the days of the week. Observe then,</p>

<p>1. That he does not intimate that the eighth
day has <i>become</i> the Sabbath in place of the seventh
which was <i>once</i> such, but he says that the
eighth day may possibly turn out to be properly
the seventh.</p>

<p>2. That in Clement’s time, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 194, there was
not any confusion in the minds of men as to
which day was the ancient Sabbath, and which
one was the first day of the week, or eighth day,
as it was often called, nor does he intimate that
there was.</p>

<p>3. But Clement, from some cause, says that possibly
the eighth day should be counted the seventh,
and the seventh day the sixth. Now, if
this should be done, it would change the numbering
of the days, not only as far back as the
resurrection of Christ, but all the way back to
the creation.</p>

<p>4. If, therefore, Clement, in this place, designed
to teach that Sunday is the Sabbath, he must
also have held that it always had been such.</p>

<p>5. But observe that, while he changes the
numbering of the days of the week, he does not
change the Sabbath from one day to another.
He says the eighth may possibly be the seventh,
and the seventh, properly the sixth, and the latter,
or this one [Greek, ἡ μὲν κυρίως εἶυαι σάββατου,],
properly the Sabbath, and the seventh a day of
work.</p>

<p>6. By the latter must be understood the day
last mentioned, which he says should be called,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
not the seventh, but the sixth; and by the seventh
must certainly be intended that day which
he says is not the eighth, but the seventh, that is
to say, Sunday.</p>

<p>There remains but one difficulty to be solved,
and that is why he should suggest the changing
of the numbering of the days of the week by
striking one from the count of each day, thus
making the Sabbath the sixth day in the count
instead of the seventh; and making Sunday the
seventh day in the count instead of the eighth.
The answer seems to have eluded the observation
of the first-day and anti-Sabbatarian writers who
have sought to grasp it. But there is a fact
which solves the difficulty. Clement’s commentary
on the fourth commandment, from which
these quotations are taken, is principally made
up of curious observations on “the perfect number
six,” “the number seven motherless and
childless,” and the number eight, which is “a
cube,” and the like matters, and is taken with
some change of arrangement almost word for
word from Philo Judæus, a teacher who flourished
at Alexandria about one century before
Clement. Whoever will take pains to compare
these two writers will find in Philo nearly all
the ideas and illustrations which Clement has
used, and the very language also in which he has
expressed them.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Philo was a mystical teacher
to whom Clement looked up as to a master. A
statement which we find in Philo, in immediate
connection with several curious ideas, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
Clement quotes from him, gives, beyond all
doubt, the key to Clement’s suggestion that possibly
the eighth day should be called the seventh,
and the seventh day called the sixth. Philo said
that, according to God’s purpose, the first day of
time was not to be numbered with the other
days of the creation week. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And he allotted each of the six days to one of the
portions of the whole, <span class="smcap">taking out the first day</span>, which
he does not even call the first day, <i>that it may not be
numbered with the others</i>, but entitling it <span class="smcap">one</span>, he names
it rightly, perceiving in it, and ascribing to it, the nature
and appellation of the limit.”<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This would simply change the numbering of
the days, as counted by Philo, and afterward
partially adopted by Clement, and make the
Sabbath, not the seventh day, but the sixth, and
Sunday, not the eighth day, but the seventh; but
it would still leave the Sabbath day and the
Sunday the same identical days as before. It
would, however, give to the Sabbath the name of
sixth day, because the first of the six days of
creation was not counted; and it would cause
the eighth day, so called in the early church because
of its coming next after the Sabbath, to be
called seventh day. Thus the Sabbath would
be the sixth day, and the seventh a day of work,
and yet the Sabbath would be the identical day
that it had ever been, and the Sunday, though
called seventh day, would still, as ever before, remain
a day on which ordinary labor was lawful.
Of course, Philo’s idea that the first day of time
should not be counted, is wholly false; for there
is not one fact in the Bible to support it, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
many which expressly contradict it, and even
Clement, with all deference to Philo, only timidly
suggests it. But when the matter is laid open,
it shows that Clement had no thought of calling
Sunday the Sabbath, and that he does expressly
confirm what we have fully proved out of other of
the fathers, that Sunday was a day on which, in
their judgment, labor was not sinful.</p>

<p>Tertullian, at different periods of his life, held
different views respecting the Sabbath, and committed
them all to writing. We last quoted from
him a decisive testimony to the perpetuity of the
Sabbath, coupled with an equally decisive testimony
against the sanctification of the first day
of the week. In another work, from which we
have already quoted his statement that Christians
should not kneel on Sunday, we find another
statement that “some few” abstained from
kneeling on the Sabbath. This has probable
reference to Carthage, where Tertullian lived.
He speaks thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the matter of <i>kneeling</i> also, prayer is subject to
diversity of observance, through the act of some few who
abstain from kneeling on the Sabbath; and since this dissension
is particularly on its trial before the churches,
the Lord will give his grace that the dissentients may either
yield, or else indulge their opinion without offense
to others.”<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The act of standing in prayer was one of the
chief honors conferred upon Sunday. Those who
refrained from kneeling on the seventh day, without
doubt did it because they desired to honor
that day. This particular act is of no consequence;
for it was adopted in imitation of those
who, from tradition and custom, thus honored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
Sunday; but we have in this an undoubted reference
to Sabbath-keeping Christians. Tertullian
speaks of them, however, in a manner quite
unlike that of Justin in his reference to the commandment-keepers
of his time.</p>

<p>Origen, like many other of the fathers, was far
from being consistent with himself. Though he
has spoken against Sabbatic observance, and has
honored the so-called Lord’s day as something
better than the ancient Sabbath, he has nevertheless
given a discourse expressly designed to
teach Christians the proper method of observing
the Sabbath. Here is a portion of this sermon:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But what is the feast of the Sabbath except that of
which the apostle speaks, ‘There remaineth therefore a
Sabbatism,’ that is, the observance of the Sabbath by the
people of God? Leaving the Jewish observances of the
Sabbath, let us see how the Sabbath ought to be observed
by a Christian. On the Sabbath day all worldly labors
ought to be abstained from. If, therefore, you cease
from all secular works, and execute nothing worldly, but
give yourselves up to spiritual exercises, repairing to
church, attending to sacred reading and instruction,
thinking of celestial things, solicitous for the future,
placing the Judgment to come before your eyes, not looking
to things present and visible, but to those which are
future and invisible, this is the observance of the Christian
Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span></p>

<p>This is by no means a bad representation of
the proper observance of the Sabbath. Such a
discourse addressed to Christians is a strong evidence
that many did then hallow that day.
Some, indeed, have claimed that these words
were spoken concerning Sunday. They would
have it that he contrasts the observance of the
first day with that of the seventh. But the contrast
is not between the different methods of
keeping two days, but between two methods of
observing one day. The Jews in Origen’s time
spent the day mainly in mere abstinence from
labor, and often added sensuality to idleness.
But the Christians were to observe it in divine
worship, as well as sacred rest. What day he
intends cannot be doubtful. It is <span class="smcap">dies Sabbati</span>,
a term which can signify only the seventh day.
Here is the first instance of the term Christian
Sabbath, <i>Sabbati Christiani</i>, and it is expressly
applied to the seventh day observed by Christians.</p>

<p>The longer form of the reputed epistle of Ignatius
to the Magnesians was not written till
after Origen’s time, but, though not written by
Ignatius, it is valuable for light which it
sheds upon the existing state of things at the
time of its composition, and for marking the
progress which apostasy had made with respect
to the Sabbath. Here is its reference to the Sabbath
and first day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after
the Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness; for
‘he that does not work, let him not eat.’ For say the
[holy] oracles, ‘In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
thy bread.’ But let every one of you keep the Sabbath
after a spiritual manner, rejoicing in meditation on the
law, not in relaxation of the body, admiring the workmanship
of God, and not eating things prepared the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a
prescribed space, nor finding delight in dancing and
plaudits which have no sense in them. And after the observance
of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep
the Lord’s day as a festival, the resurrection day, the
queen and chief of all the days [of the week]. Looking
forward to this, the prophet declared, ‘To the end, for
the eighth day,’ on which our life both sprang up again,
and the victory over death was obtained in Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This writer specifies the different things which
made up the Jewish observance of the Sabbath.
They may be summed up under two heads. 1.
Strict abstinence from labor. 2. Dancing and
carousal. Now, in the light of what Origen has
said, we can understand the contrast which this
writer draws between the Jewish and Christian
observance of the Sabbath. The error of the Jews
in the first part of this was that they contented
themselves with mere bodily relaxation, without
raising their thoughts to God, the Creator, and this
mere idleness soon gave place to sensual folly.</p>

<p>The Christian, as Origen draws the contrast,
refrains from labor on the Sabbath that he may
raise his heart in grateful worship. Or, as this
writer draws it, the Christian keeps the Sabbath
in a spiritual manner, rejoicing in meditation on
the law; but to do thus, he must hallow it in
the manner which that law commands, that is,
in the observance of a sacred rest which commemorates
the rest of the Creator. The writer
evidently believed in the observance of the Sabbath
as an act of obedience to that law on which
they were to meditate on that day. And the
nature of the epistle indicates that it was observed,
at all events, in the country where it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
written. But mark the work of apostasy. The
so-called Lord’s day for which the writer could
offer nothing better than an argument drawn
from the title of the sixth psalm (see its marginal
reading) is exalted above the Lord’s holy
day, and made the queen of all days!</p>

<p>The Apostolical Constitutions, though not
written in apostolic times, were in existence as
early as the third century, and were then very
generally believed to express the doctrine of the
apostles. They do therefore furnish important
historical testimony to the practice of the church
at that time, and also indicate the great progress
which apostasy had made. Guericke speaks thus
of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is a collection of ecclesiastical statutes purporting
to be the work of the apostolic age, but in reality
formed gradually in the second, third, and fourth centuries,
and is of much value in reference to the history of
polity, and Christian archæology generally.”<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mosheim says of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The matter of this work is unquestionably ancient;
since the manners and discipline of which it exhibits a
view are those which prevailed amongst the Christians
of the second and third centuries, especially those resident
in Greece and the oriental regions.”<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These Constitutions indicate that the Sabbath
was extensively observed in the third century.
They also show the standing of the Sunday festival
in that century. After solemnly enjoining
the sacred observance of the ten commandments,
they thus enforce the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Consider the manifold workmanship of God, which
received its beginning through Christ. Thou shalt observe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
the Sabbath, on account of Him who ceased from
his work of creation, but ceased not from his work of
providence: it is a rest for meditation of the law, not for
idleness of the hands.”<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is sound Sabbatarian doctrine. To show
how distinctly these Constitutions recognize the
decalogue as the foundation of Sabbatic authority
we quote the words next preceding the above,
though we have quoted them on another occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Have before thine eyes the fear of God, and always
remember the ten commandments of God,—to love the
one and only Lord God with all thy strength; to give
no heed to idols, or any other beings, as being lifeless
gods, or irrational beings or dæmons.”<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But though these Constitutions thus recognize
the authority of the decalogue and the sacred obligation
of the seventh day, they elevate the
Sunday festival in some respects to higher honor
than the Sabbath, though they claim for it no
precept of the Scriptures. Thus they say:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But keep the Sabbath, and the Lord’s day festival;
because the former is the memorial of the creation, and
the latter of the resurrection.”<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the Sabbath is the ceasing of the creation, the
completion of the world, the inquiry after laws, and the
grateful praise to God for the blessings he has bestowed
upon men. All which the Lord’s day excels, and
shows the Mediator himself, the Provider, the Law-giver,
the Cause of the resurrection, the First-born of the whole
creation.”<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So that the Lord’s day commands us to offer unto
thee, O Lord, thanksgiving for all. For this is the grace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
afforded by thee, which, on account of its greatness, has
obscured all other blessings.”<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tested by his own principles, the writer of
these Constitutions was far advanced in apostasy;
for he held a festival, for which he claimed no divine
authority, more honorable than one which
he acknowledged to be ordained of God. There
could be but one step more in this course, and
that would be to set aside the commandment of
God for the ordinance of man, and this step was
not very long afterward actually taken. One
other point should be noticed. It is said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let the slaves work five days; but on the Sabbath
day and the Lord’s day let them have leisure to go to
church for instruction in piety.”<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The question of the sinfulness of labor on
either of these days is not here taken into the
account; for the reason assigned is that the slaves
may have leisure to attend public worship. But
while these Constitutions elsewhere forbid labor
on the Sabbath on the authority of the decalogue,
they do not forbid it upon the first day of the
week. Take the following as an example:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“O Lord Almighty, thou hast created the world by
Christ, and hast appointed the Sabbath in memory thereof,
because that <i>on that day</i> thou hast made us <i>rest from
our works</i>, for the meditation upon thy laws.”<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Apostolical Constitutions are valuable to
us, not as authority respecting the teaching of
the apostles, but as giving us a knowledge of the
views and practices which prevailed in the third
century. As these Constitutions were extensively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
regarded as embodying the doctrine of
the apostles, they furnish conclusive evidence
that, at the time when they were put in writing,
the ten commandments were very generally
revered as the immutable rule of right, and
that the Sabbath of the Lord was by many observed
as an act of obedience to the fourth commandment,
and as the divine memorial of the
creation. They also show that the first-day festival
had, in the third century, attained such
strength and influence as to clearly indicate that
ere long it would claim the entire ground. But
observe that the Sabbath and the so-called
Lord’s day were then regarded as distinct institutions,
and that no hint of the change of the
Sabbath from the seventh day to the first is even
once given.</p>

<p>Thus much out of the fathers concerning the
authority of the decalogue, and concerning the
perpetuity and observance of the ancient Sabbath.
The suppression of the Sabbath of the
Bible, and the elevation of Sunday to its place,
has been shown to be in no sense the work of
the Saviour. But so great a work required the
united action of powerful causes, and these causes
we now enumerate.</p>

<p>1. <i>Hatred toward the Jews.</i> This people, who
retained the ancient Sabbath, had slain Christ.
It was easy for men to forget that Christ, as Lord
of the Sabbath, had claimed it as his own institution,
and to call the Sabbath a Jewish institution
which Christians should not regard.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>2. <i>The hatred of the church of Rome toward
the Sabbath, and its determination to elevate
Sunday to the highest place.</i> This church, as the
chief in the work of apostasy, took the lead in
the earliest effort to suppress the Sabbath by
turning it into a fast. And the very first act of
papal aggression was by an edict in behalf of
Sunday. Thenceforward, in every possible form,
this church continued this work until the pope
announced that he had received a divine mandate
for Sunday observance [the very thing lacking]
in a roll which fell from Heaven.</p>

<p>3. <i>The voluntary observance of memorable
days.</i> In the Christian church, almost from the
beginning, men voluntarily honored the fourth,
the sixth, and the first days of the week, and
also the anniversary of the Passover and the
Pentecost, to commemorate the betrayal, the
death, and the resurrection, of Christ, and the
descent of the Holy Spirit, which acts in themselves
could not be counted sinful.</p>

<p>4. <i>The making of tradition of equal authority
with the Scriptures.</i> This was the great error of
the early church, and the one to which that
church was specially exposed, as having in it
those who had seen the apostles, or who had seen
those who had seen them. It was this which
rendered the voluntary observance of memorable
days a dangerous thing. For what began as a
voluntary observance became, after the lapse of
a few years, a standing custom, established by
tradition, which must be obeyed because it came
from those who had seen the apostles, or from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
those who had seen others who had seen them.
This is the origin of the various errors of the
great apostasy.</p>

<p>5. <i>The entrance of the no-law heresy.</i> This is
seen in Justin Martyr, the earliest witness to the
Sunday festival, and in the church of Rome of
which he was then a member.</p>

<p>6. <i>The extensive observance of Sunday as a
heathen festival.</i> The first day of the week corresponded
to the widely observed heathen festival
of the sun. It was therefore easy to unite
the honor of Christ in the observance of the day
of his resurrection with the convenience and
worldly advantage of his people in having the
same festival day with their heathen neighbors,
and to make it a special act of piety in that the
conversion of the heathen was thereby facilitated,
while the neglect of the ancient Sabbath was
justified by stigmatizing that divine memorial
as a Jewish institution with which Christians
should have no concern.</p>

<p>The origin of the Sabbath and of the festival
of Sunday is now distinctly understood. When
God made the world, he gave to man the Sabbath
that he might not forget the Creator of all things.
When men apostatized from God, Satan turned
them to the worship of the sun, and, as a standing
memorial of their veneration for that luminary,
caused them to dedicate to his honor the first
day of the week. When the elements of apostasy
had sufficiently matured in the Christian church,
this ancient festival stood forth as a rival to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
Sabbath of the Lord. The manner in which it
obtained a foothold in the Christian church has
been already shown; and many facts which have
an important bearing upon the struggle between
these rival institutions have also been given. We
have, in the preceding chapters, given the statements
of the most ancient Christian writers respecting
the Sabbath and first-day in the early
church. As we now trace the history of these
two days during the first five centuries of the
Christian era, we shall give the statements of
modern church historians, covering the same
ground with the early fathers, and shall also
quote in continuation of the ancient writers the
testimonies of the earliest church historians.
The reader can thus discover how nearly the ancients
and moderns agree. Of the observance of
the Sabbath in the early church, Morer speaks
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The primitive Christians had a great veneration for
the Sabbath, and spent the day in devotion and sermons.
And it is not to be doubted but they derived this practice
from the apostles themselves, as appears by several scriptures
to that purpose; who, keeping both that day and
the first of the week, gave occasion to the succeeding
ages to join them together, and make it one festival,
though there was not the same reason for the continuance
of the custom as there was to begin it.”<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A learned English first-day writer of the seventeenth
century, William Twisse, D. D., thus states
the early history of these two days:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yet for some hundred years in the primitive church,
not the Lord’s day only, but the seventh day also, was
religiously observed, not by Ebion and Cerinthus only,
but by pious Christians also, as Baronius writeth, and
Gomarus confesseth, and Rivet also, that we are bound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
in conscience under the gospel, to allow for God’s service
a better proportion of time, than the Jews did under the
law, rather than a worse.”<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That the observance of the Sabbath was not
confined to Jewish converts, the learned Giesler
explicitly testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“While the Jewish Christians of Palestine retained
the entire Mosaic law, and consequently the Jewish festivals,
the Gentile Christians observed also <i>the Sabbath</i> and
the passover,<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> with reference to the last scenes of Jesus’
life, but without Jewish superstition. In addition to
these, Sunday, as the day of Christ’s resurrection, was
devoted to religious services.”<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The statement of Mosheim may be thought to
contradict that of Giesler. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The seventh day of the week was also observed as a
festival, not by the Christians in general, but by such
churches only as were principally composed of Jewish
converts, nor did the other Christians censure this custom
as criminal and unlawful.”<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed that Mosheim does not deny
that the Jewish converts observed the Sabbath.
He denies that this was done by the Gentile
Christians. The proof on which he rests this
denial is thus stated by him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The churches of Bithynia, of which Pliny speaks, in
his letter to Trajan, had only one stated day for the celebration
of public worship; and that was undoubtedly
the first day of the week, or what we call the Lord’s
day.”<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span></p>

<p>The proposition to be proved is this: The Gentile
Christians did not observe the Sabbath. The
proof is found in the following fact: The churches
of Bithynia assembled on a stated day for the
celebration of divine worship. It is seen therefore
that the conclusion is gratuitous, and wholly
unauthorized by the testimony.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> But this instance
shows the dexterity of Mosheim in drawing
inferences, and gives us some insight into the
kind of evidence which supports some of these
sweeping statements in behalf of Sunday. Who
can say that this “stated day” was not the very
day enjoined in the fourth commandment? Of the
Sabbath and first day in the early ages of the
church, Coleman speaks as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The last day of the week was strictly kept in connection
with that of the first day, for a long time after the
overthrow of the temple and its worship. Down even to
the fifth century the observance of the Jewish Sabbath
was continued in the Christian church, but with a rigor
and solemnity gradually diminishing until it was wholly
discontinued.”<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is a most explicit acknowledgment that
the Bible Sabbath was long observed by the
body of the Christian church. Coleman is a first-day
writer, and therefore not likely to state the
case too strongly in behalf of the seventh day.
He is a modern writer, but we have already
proved his statements true out of the ancients.
It is true that Coleman speaks also of the first
day of the week, yet his subsequent language
shows that it was a long while before this became
a sacred day. Thus he says:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the early ages of the church it was never entitled
‘the Sabbath,’ this word being confined to the
seventh day of the week, the Jewish Sabbath, which, as
we have already said, continued to be observed for several
centuries by the converts to Christianity.”<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This fact is made still clearer by the following
language, in which this historian admits Sunday
to be nothing but a human ordinance:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No law or precept appears to have been given by
Christ or the apostles, either for the abrogation of the
Jewish Sabbath, or the institution of the Lord’s day,
or the substitution of the first for the seventh day of the
week.”<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Coleman does not seem to realize that in making
this truthful statement he has directly acknowledged
that the ancient Sabbath is still in
full force as a divine institution, and that first-day
observance is only authorized by the traditions
of men. He next relates the manner in
which this Sunday festival which had been nourished
in the bosom of the church usurped the
place of the Lord’s Sabbath; a warning to all
Christians of the tendency of human institutions,
if cherished by the people of God, to destroy
those which are divine. Let this important language
be carefully pondered. He speaks thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The observance of the Lord’s day was ordered while
yet the Sabbath of the Jews was continued; nor was the
latter superseded until the former had acquired the same
solemnity and importance, which belonged, at first, to
that great day which God originally ordained and blessed....
But in time, after the Lord’s day was fully
established, the observance of the Sabbath of the Jews
was gradually discontinued, and was finally denounced
as heretical.”<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus is seen the result of cherishing this harmless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
Sunday festival in the church. It only asked
toleration at first; but gaining strength by degrees,
it gradually undermined the Sabbath of
the Lord, and finally denounced its observance
as heretical.</p>

<p>Jeremy Taylor, a distinguished bishop of the
Church of England, and a man of great erudition,
but a decided opponent of Sabbatic obligation,
confirms the testimony of Coleman. He affirms
that the Sabbath was observed by the Christians
of the first three hundred years, but denies that
they did this out of respect to the authority or
the law of God. But we have shown from the
fathers that those who hallowed the Sabbath did
it as an act of obedience to the fourth commandment,
and that the decalogue was acknowledged
as of perpetual obligation, and as the perfect
rule of right. As Bishop T. denies that this was
their ground of observance, he should have shown
some other, which he has not done. Thus he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Lord’s day did not succeed in the place of the
Sabbath, but the Sabbath was wholly abrogated, and the
Lord’s day was merely an ecclesiastical institution. It
was not introduced by virtue of the fourth commandment,
because they for almost three hundred years together
kept that day which was in that commandment; but they
did it also without any opinion of prime obligation, and
therefore they did not suppose it moral.”<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That such an opinion relative to the obligation
of the fourth commandment had gained ground
extensively among the leaders of the church, as
early at least as the fourth century, and probably
in the third, is sufficiently attested by the action
of the council of Laodicea, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 364, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
anathematized those who should observe the Sabbath,
as will be noticed in its place. That this
loose view of the morality of the fourth commandment
was resisted by many, is shown by
the existence of various bodies of steadfast Sabbatarians
in that age, whose memory has come
down to us; and also by the fact that that council
made such a vigorous effort to put down the
Sabbath. Coleman has clearly portrayed the gradual
depression of the Sabbath, as the first-day
festival arose in strength, until Sabbath-keeping
became heretical, when, by ecclesiastical authority,
the Sabbath was suppressed, and the festival
of Sunday became fully established as a new and
different institution. The natural consequence of
this is seen in the rise of distinct sects, or bodies,
who were distinguished for their observance
of the seventh day. That they should be denounced
as heretical and falsely charged with
many errors is not surprising, when we consider
that their memory has been handed down to us by
their opponents, and that Sabbath-keepers in our
own time are not unfrequently treated in this
very manner. The first of these ancient Sabbatarian
bodies was the Nazarenes. Of these, Morer
testifies that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>They “retained the Sabbath; and though they pretended
to believe as Christians, yet they practiced as
Jews, and so were in reality neither one nor the other.”<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Dr. Francis White, lord bishop of Ely,
mentions the Nazarenes as one of the ancient
bodies of Sabbath-keepers who were condemned
by the church leaders for that heresy; and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
classes them with heretics as Morer has done.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
Yet the Nazarenes have a peculiar claim to our
regard, as being in reality the apostolic church of
Jerusalem, and its direct successors. Thus Gibbon
testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Jewish converts, or, as they were afterwards
called, the Nazarenes, who had laid the foundations of
the church, soon found themselves overwhelmed by the
increasing multitudes, that from all the various religions
of polytheism enlisted under the banner of Christ....
The Nazarenes retired from the ruins of Jerusalem to the
little town of Pella beyond the Jordan, where that ancient
church languished above sixty years in solitude and
obscurity.”<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is not strange that that church which fled
out of Judea at the word of Christ<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> should long
retain the Sabbath, as it appears that they did,
even as late as the fourth century. Morer mentions
another class of Sabbath-keepers in the following
language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“About the same time were the Hypsistarii who closed
with these as to what concerned the Sabbath, yet would
by no means accept circumcision as too plain a testimony
of ancient bondage. All these were heretics, and so adjudged
to be by the Catholic church. Yet their hypocrisy
and industry were such as gained them a considerable
footing in the Christian world.”<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The bishop of Ely names these also as a body
of Sabbath-keepers whose heresy was condemned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
by the church.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> The learned Joseph Bingham,
M. A., gives the following account of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There was another sect which called themselves Hypsistarians,
that is, worshipers of the most high God, whom
they worshiped as the Jews only in one person. And
they observed their Sabbaths and used distinction of
meats, clean and unclean, though they did not regard
circumcision, as Gregory Nazianzen, whose father was once
one of this sect, gives the account of them.”<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It must ever be remembered that these people,
whom the Catholic church adjudged to be heretics,
are not speaking for themselves: their enemies
who condemned them have transmitted to
posterity all that is known of their history. It
would be well if heretics, who meet with little
mercy at the hand of ecclesiastical writers, could
at least secure the impartial justice of a truthful
record.</p>

<p>Another class are thus described by Cox in his
elaborate work entitled “Sabbath Laws and Sabbath
Duties”:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this way [that is, by presenting the testimony of
the Bible on the subject] arose the ancient Sabbatarians,
a body it is well known of very considerable importance
in respect both to numbers and influence, during the
greater part of the third and the early part of the next
century.”<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The close of the third century witnessed the
Sabbath much weakened in its hold upon the
church in general, and the festival of Sunday, although
possessed of no divine authority, steadily
gaining in strength and in sacredness. The following
historical testimony from a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
English Church, Edward Brerewood, professor in
Gresham College, London, gives a good general
view of the matter, though the author’s anti-Sabbatarian
views are mixed with it. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The ancient Sabbath did remain and was observed together
with the celebration of the Lord’s day by the Christians
of the east church above three hundred years after
our Saviour’s death; and besides that, no other day for
more hundreds of years than I spake of before, was known
in the church by the name of Sabbath but that: let the
collection thereof and conclusion of all be this: The Sabbath
of the seventh day as touching the allegations of
God’s solemn worship to time was ceremonial; that Sabbath
was religiously observed in the east church three
hundred years and more after our Saviour’s passion.
That church being the great part of Christendom, and
having the apostles’ doctrine and example to instruct
them, would have restrained it if it had been deadly.”<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was the case in the eastern churches at
the end of the third century; but in such of the
western churches as sympathized with the church
of Rome, the Sabbath had been treated as a fast
from the beginning of that century, to express
their opposition toward those who observed it according
to the commandment.</p>

<p>In the early part of the fourth century occurred
an event which could not have been foreseen, but
which threw an immense weight in favor of Sunday
into the balances already trembling between
the rival institutions, the Sabbath of the Lord
and the festival of the sun. This was nothing
less than an edict from the throne of the Roman
Empire in behalf of “the venerable day of the
sun.” It was issued by the emperor Constantine
in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 321, and is thus expressed:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let all the judges and town people, and the occupation
of all trades rest on the venerable day of the sun;
but let those who are situated in the country, freely and
at full liberty attend to the business of agriculture; because
it often happens that no other day is so fit for sowing
corn and planting vines; lest, the critical moment
being let slip, men should lose the commodities granted
by Heaven. Given the seventh day of March; Crispus
and Constantine being consuls, each of them for the second
time.”<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of this law, a high authority thus speaks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was Constantine the Great who first made a law for
the proper observance of Sunday; and who, according to
Eusebius, appointed it should be regularly celebrated
throughout the Roman Empire. Before him, and even
in his time, they observed the Jewish Sabbath, as well as
Sunday; both to satisfy the law of Moses, and to imitate
the apostles who used to meet together on the first day.
By Constantine’s law, promulgated in 321, it was decreed
that for the future the Sunday should be kept as a day of
rest in all cities and towns; but he allowed the country
people to follow their work.”<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another eminent authority thus states the purport
of this law:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Constantine the Great made a law for the whole empire
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 321) that Sunday should be kept as a day of
rest in all cities and towns; but he allowed the country
people to follow their work on that day.”<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span></p>

<p>Thus the fact is placed beyond all dispute that
this decree gave full permission to all kinds of
agricultural labor. The following testimony of
Mosheim is therefore worthy of strict attention:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first day of the week, which was the ordinary
and stated time for the public assemblies of the Christians,
was in consequence of a peculiar law enacted by
Constantine, observed with greater solemnity than it had
formerly been.”<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What will the advocates of first-day sacredness
say to this? They quote Mosheim respecting
Sunday observance in the first century—which
testimony has been carefully examined in this
work<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>—and they seem to think that his language
in support of first-day sacredness is nearly equal
in authority to the language of the New Testament;
in fact, they regard it as supplying an
important omission in that book. Yet Mosheim
states respecting Constantine’s Sunday law, promulgated
in the fourth century, which restrained
merchants and mechanics, but allowed all kinds
of agricultural labor on that day, that it caused
the day to be “observed with greater solemnity
than it had formerly been.” It follows, therefore,
on Mosheim’s own showing, that Sunday, during
the first three centuries, was not a day of abstinence
from labor in the Christian church. On
this point, Bishop Taylor thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The primitive Christians did all manner of works upon
the Lord’s day, even in the times of persecution, when
they are the strictest observers of all the divine commandments;
but in this they knew there was none; and
therefore when Constantine the emperor had made an
edict against working upon the Lord’s day, yet he excepts
and still permitted all agriculture or labors of the
husbandman whatsoever.”<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span></p>

<p>Morer tells us respecting the first three centuries,
that is to say, the period before Constantine,
that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Lord’s day had no command that it should be
sanctified, but it was left to God’s people to pitch on this
or that day for the public worship. And being taken up
and made a day of meeting for religious exercises, yet for
three hundred years there was no law to bind them to it,
and for want of such a law, the day was not wholly kept
in abstaining from common business; nor did they any
longer rest from their ordinary affairs (such was the
necessity of those times) than during the divine service.”<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Sir Wm. Domville says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Centuries of the Christian era passed away before the
Sunday was observed by the Christian church as a Sabbath.
History does not furnish us with a single proof or
indication that it was at any time so observed previous to
the Sabbatical edict of Constantine in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 321.”<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What these able modern writers set forth as to
labor on Sunday before the edict of Constantine
was promulgated, we have fully proved in the
preceding chapters out of the most ancient ecclesiastical
writers. That such an edict could not
fail to strengthen the current already strongly
set in favor of Sunday, and greatly to weaken
the influence of the Sabbath, cannot be doubted.
Of this fact, an able writer bears witness:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Very shortly after the period when Constantine issued
his edict enjoining the general observance of Sunday
throughout the Roman Empire, the party that had
contended for the observance of the seventh day dwindled
into insignificance. The observance of Sunday as a
public festival, during which all business, with the exception
of rural employments, was intermitted, came to be
more and more generally established ever after this time,
throughout both the Greek and the Latin churches.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
There is no evidence however that either at this, or at a
period much later, the observance was viewed as deriving
any obligation from the fourth commandment; it seems
to have been regarded as an institution corresponding in
nature with Christmas, Good Friday, and other festivals
of the church; and as resting with them on the ground
of ecclesiastical authority and tradition.”<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This extraordinary edict of Constantine caused
Sunday to be observed with greater solemnity
than it had formerly been. Yet we have the
most indubitable proof that this law was a heathen
enactment; that it was put forth in favor
of Sunday as a heathen institution and not as a
Christian festival; and that Constantine himself
not only did not possess the character of a Christian,
but was at that time in truth a heathen.
It is to be observed that Constantine did not designate
the day which he commanded men to
keep, as Lord’s day, Christian Sabbath, or the
day of Christ’s resurrection; nor does he assign
any reason for its observance which would indicate
it as a Christian festival. On the contrary,
he designates the ancient heathen festival of the
sun in language that cannot be mistaken. Dr.
Hessey thus sustains this statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Others have looked at the transaction in a totally
different light, and refused to discover in the document,
or to suppose in the mind of the enactor, any recognition
of the Lord’s day as a matter of divine obligation. They
remark, and <i>very truly</i>, that Constantine designates it by
its <i>astrological</i> or <i>heathen</i> title, Dies Solis, and insist that
the epithet <i>venerabilis</i> with which it is introduced has reference
to the rites performed on that day in honor of
<i>Hercules</i>, <i>Apollo</i>, and <i>Mithras</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span></p>

<p>On this important point, Milman, the learned
editor of Gibbon, thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The rescript commanding the celebration of the
Christian Sabbath, bears no allusion to its peculiar sanctity
as a Christian institution. It is the day of the sun
which is to be observed by the general veneration; the
courts were to be closed, and the noise and tumult of
public business and legal litigation were no longer to violate
the repose of the sacred day. But the believer in
the new paganism, of which the solar worship was the
characteristic, might acquiesce without scruple in the
sanctity of the first day of the week.”<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And he adds in a subsequent chapter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In fact, as we have before observed, the day of the
sun would be willingly hallowed by almost all the pagan
world, especially that part which had admitted any tendency
towards the Oriental theology.”<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the seventh day of March, Constantine
published his edict commanding the observance
of that ancient festival of the heathen, the venerable
day of the sun. On the following day,
March eighth,<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> he issued a second decree in every
respect worthy of its heathen predecessor.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> The
purport of it was this: That if any royal edifice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
should be struck by lightning, the ancient ceremonies
of propitiating the deity should be practiced,
and the <i>haruspices</i> were to be consulted to
learn the meaning of the awful portent.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> The
<i>haruspices</i> were soothsayers who foretold future
events by examining the entrails of beasts
slaughtered in sacrifice to the gods!<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> The statute
of the seventh of March enjoining the observance
of the venerable day of the sun, and
that of the eighth of the same month commanding
the consultation of the <i>haruspices</i>, constitute
a noble pair of well-matched heathen edicts.
That Constantine himself was a heathen at the
time these edicts were issued, is shown not only
by the nature of the edicts themselves, but by
the fact that his nominal conversion to Christianity
is placed by Mosheim two years after his
Sunday law. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After well considering the subject, I have come to
the conclusion, that <i>subsequently to the death of Licinius
in the year 323</i> when <i>Constantine</i> found himself sole emperor,
<i>he became an absolute Christian</i>, or one who believes
no religion but the Christian to be acceptable to God.
He had previously considered the religion of one God as
more excellent than the other religions, and believed that
Christ ought especially to be worshiped: yet he supposed
there were also inferior deities, and that to these some
worship might be paid, in the manner of the fathers, without
fault or sin. And who does not know, that in those
times, many others also combined the worship of Christ
with that of the ancient gods, whom they regarded as the
ministers of the supreme God in the government of human
and earthly affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As a heathen, Constantine was the worshiper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
of Apollo or the sun, a fact that sheds much light
upon his edict enjoining men to observe the venerable
day of the sun. Thus Gibbon testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The devotion of Constantine was more peculiarly directed
to the genius of the sun, the Apollo of Greek and
Roman mythology; and he was pleased to be represented
with the symbols of the god of light and poetry....
The altars of Apollo were crowned with the votive offerings
of Constantine; and the credulous multitude were
taught to believe that the emperor was permitted to behold
with mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tutelar
deity.... The sun was universally celebrated as the
invincible guide and protector of Constantine.”<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

</div>

<p>His character as a professor of Christianity is
thus described:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The sincerity of the man, who in a short period effected
such amazing changes in the religious world, is best
known to Him who searches the heart. Certain it is that
his subsequent life furnished no evidence of conversion to
God. He waded without remorse through seas of blood,
and was a most tyrannical prince.”<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A few words relative to his character as a man
will complete our view of his fitness to legislate
for the church. This man, when elevated to the
highest place of earthly power, caused his eldest
son, Crispus, to be privately murdered, lest the
fame of the son should eclipse that of the father.
In the same ruin was involved his nephew Licinius,
“whose rank was his only crime,” and this
was followed by the execution “perhaps of a
guilty wife.”<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>Such was the man who elevated Sunday to the
throne of the Roman Empire; and such the
nature of the institution which he thus elevated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
A recent English writer says of Constantine’s
Sunday law that it “would seem to have been
rather to promote heathen than Christian worship.”
And he shows how this heathen emperor
became a Christian, and how this heathen statute
became a Christian law. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At a <span class="smcap">later period</span>, carried away by the current of
opinion, he declared himself a convert to the church.
Christianity, then, or what he was pleased to call by that
name, became the law of the land, and the edict of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
321, being unrevoked, was enforced as a Christian ordinance.”<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus it is seen that a law, enacted in support
of a heathen institution, after a few years came
to be considered a Christian ordinance; and Constantine
himself, four years after his Sunday
edict, was able to control the church, as represented
in the general council of Nice, so as to
cause the members of that council to establish
their annual festival of the passover upon Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
Paganism had prepared the institution
from ancient days, and had now elevated it to
supreme power; its work was accomplished.</p>

<p>We have proved that the Sunday festival in
the Christian church had no Sabbatical character
before the time of Constantine. We have also
shown that heathenism, in the person of Constantine,
first gave to Sunday its Sabbatical
character, and, in the very act of doing it, designated
it as a heathen, and not as a Christian, festival,
thus establishing a heathen Sabbath. It was
now the part of popery authoritatively to effect
its transformation into a Christian institution; a
work which it was not slow to perform. Sylvester<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
was the bishop of Rome while Constantine
was emperor. How faithfully he acted his part
in transforming the festival of the sun into a
Christian institution is seen in that, by his apostolic
authority, he changed the name of the day,
giving it the imposing title of <span class="smcap">Lord’s day</span>.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> To
Constantine and to Sylvester, therefore, the advocates
of first-day observance are greatly indebted.
The one elevated it as a heathen festival
to the throne of the empire, making it a day
of rest from most kinds of business; the other
changed it into a Christian institution, giving it
the dignified appellation of Lord’s day. It is not
a sufficient reason for denying that Pope Sylvester,
not far from <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 325, authoritatively conferred
on Sunday the name of Lord’s day, to say
that one of the fathers, as early as <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 200, calls
the day by that name, and that some seven different
writers, between <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 200 and <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 325,
viz., Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, Anatolius, Commodianus,
Victorinus, and Peter of Alexandria,
can be adduced, who give this name to Sunday.</p>

<p>No one of these fathers ever claims for this title
any apostolic authority; and it has been already
shown that they could not have believed the
day to be the Lord’s day by divine appointment.
So far, therefore, is the use of this term by these
persons as a name for Sunday from conflicting
with the statement that Sylvester, by his apostolic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
authority, established this name as the
rightful title of that day, that it shows the act
of Sylvester to be exactly suited to the circumstances
of the case. Indeed, Nicephorus asserts
that Constantine, who considered himself quite as
much the head of the church as was the pope,
“directed that the day which the Jews considered
the first day of the week, and which the
Greeks dedicated to the sun, should be called the
Lord’s day.”<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> The circumstances of the case render
the statements of Lucius and Nicephorus in
the highest degree probable. They certainly do
not indicate that the pope would deem such act
on his part unnecessary. Take a recent event
in papal history as an illustration of this case.
Only a few years since, Pius IX. decreed that the
virgin Mary was born without sin. This had
long been asserted by many distinguished writers
in the papal church, but it lacked authority
as a dogma of that church until the pope, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
1854, gave it his official sanction.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> It was the
work of Constantine and of Sylvester in the
early part of the fourth century to establish the
festival of the sun, to be a day of rest, by the authority
of the empire, and to render it a Christian
institution by the authority of St. Peter.</p>

<p>The following from Dr. Heylyn, a distinguished
member of the Church of England, is worthy of
particular attention. In most forcible language,
he traces the steps by which the Sunday festival
arose to power, contrasting it in this respect with
the ancient Sabbath of the Lord; and then, with
equal truth and candor, he acknowledges that, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
the festival of Sunday was set up by the emperor
and the church, the same power can take it down
whenever it sees fit. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus do we see upon what grounds the Lord’s day
stands; <span class="smcap">on custom first</span>, and <span class="smcap">voluntary</span> consecration
of it to religious meetings; that custom countenanced by
the authority of the church of God, which <span class="smcap">tacitly</span> approved
the same; and <span class="smcap">finally confirmed</span> and <span class="smcap">ratified
by Christian princes</span> throughout their empires. And
as the day for rest from labors and restraint from business
upon that day, [it] received its greatest strength
from the supreme magistrate as long as he retained that
power which to him belongs; as after from the canons
and decrees of councils, the decretals of popes and orders
of particular prelates, when the sole managing of ecclesiastical
affairs was committed to them.</p>

<p>“I hope it was not so with the former Sabbath, which
neither took original from custom, that people being not
so forward to give God a day; nor required any countenance
or authority from the kings of Israel to confirm
and ratify it. The Lord had spoke the word, that he
would have one day in seven, precisely the seventh day
from the world’s creation, to be a day of rest unto all his
people; which said, there was no more to do but gladly
to submit and obey his pleasure.... But thus it
was not done in our present business. The Lord’s day
had no such command that it should be sanctified, but
was left plainly to God’s people to pitch on this, <i>or any
other</i>, for the public use. And being taken up amongst
them and made a day of meeting in the congregation for
religious exercises; yet for three hundred years there was
neither law to bind them to it, nor any rest from labor or
from worldly business required upon it.</p>

<p>“And when it seemed good unto Christian princes, the
nursing fathers of God’s church, to lay restraints upon
their people, yet at the first they were not general; but
only thus that certain men in certain places should lay
aside their ordinary and daily works, to attend God’s service
in the church; those whose employments were most
toilsome and most repugnant to the true nature of a Sabbath,
being allowed to follow and pursue their labors because
most necessary to the commonwealth.</p>

<p>“And in the following times, when as the prince and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
prelate, in their several places endeavored to restrain
them from that also, which formerly they had permitted,
and interdicted almost all kinds of bodily labor upon that
day; it was not brought about without much struggling
and an opposition of the people; more than a thousand
years being past, after Christ’s ascension, before the
Lord’s day had attained that state in which now it standeth....
And being brought into that state, wherein
now it stands, it doth not stand so firmly and on such
sure grounds, but that those powers which raised it up
may take it lower if they please, yea take it quite away
as unto the time, and settle it on any other day as to
them seems best.”<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Constantine’s edict marks a signal change in
the history of the Sunday festival. Dr. Heylyn
thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hitherto have we spoken of the Lord’s day as taken
up by the common consent of the church; not instituted
or established by any text of Scripture, or edict of emperor,
or decree of council.... In that which followeth,
we shall find both emperors and councils very frequent
in ordering things about this day and the service
of it.”<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After his professed conversion to Christianity,
Constantine still further exerted his power in behalf
of the venerable day of the sun, now happily
transformed into the Lord’s day, by the
apostolic authority of the Roman bishop. Heylyn
thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So natural a power it is in a Christian prince to order
things about religion, that he not only took upon him
to command the day, but also to prescribe the service.”<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The influence of Constantine powerfully contributed
to the aid of those church leaders who
were intent upon bringing the forms of pagan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
worship into the Christian church. Gibbon thus
places upon record the motives of these men, and
the result of their action:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The most respectable bishops had persuaded themselves
that the ignorant rustics would more cheerfully renounce
the superstition of paganism, if they found some
resemblance, some compensation, in the bosom of Christianity.
The religion of Constantine achieved in less
than a century, the final conquest of the Roman Empire:
but the victors themselves were insensibly subdued by the
arts of their vanquished rivals.”<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The body of nominal Christians, which resulted
from this strange union of pagan rites with
Christian worship, arrogated to itself the title of
Catholic church, while the true people of God,
who resisted these dangerous innovations, were
branded as heretics, and cast out of the church.
It is not strange that the Sabbath should lose
ground in such a body, in its struggle with its
rival, the festival of the sun. Indeed, after a
brief period, the history of the Sabbath will be
found only in the almost obliterated records of
those whom the Catholic church cast out and
stigmatized as heretics. Of the Sabbath in Constantine’s
time, Heylyn says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As for the Saturday, that retained its wonted credit
in the eastern churches, little inferior to the Lord’s day,
if not plainly equal; not as a Sabbath, think not so; but
as a day designed unto sacred meetings.”<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is no doubt that, after the great flood of
worldliness which entered the church at the time
of Constantine’s pretended conversion, and after
all that was done by himself and by Sylvester in
behalf of Sunday, the observance of the Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
became, with many, only a nominal thing. But
the action of the council of Laodicea, to which
we shall presently come, proves conclusively that
the Sabbath was still observed, not simply as a
festival, as Heylyn would have it, but as a day
of abstinence from labor, as enjoined in the commandment.
The work of Constantine, however,
marks an epoch in the history of the Sabbath
and of Sunday. Constantine was hostile to the
Sabbath, and his influence told powerfully against
it with all those who sought worldly advancement.
The historian Eusebius was the special
friend and eulogist of Constantine. This fact
should not be overlooked in weighing his testimony
concerning the Sabbath. He speaks of it
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They [the patriarchs] did not, therefore, regard circumcision,
nor observe the Sabbath, nor do we; neither
do we abstain from certain foods, nor regard other injunctions,
which Moses subsequently delivered to be observed
in types and symbols, because such things as these do not
belong to Christians.”<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This testimony shows precisely the views of
Constantine and the imperial party relative to
the Sabbath. But it does not give the views of
Christians as a whole; for we have seen that the
Sabbath had been extensively retained up to this
point, and we shall soon have occasion to quote
other historians, the cotemporaries and successors
of Eusebius, who record its continued observance.
Constantine exerted a controlling influence in
the church, and was determined to “have nothing
in common with that most hostile rabble of
the Jews.” Happy would it have been had his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
aversion been directed against the festivals of the
heathen rather than against the Sabbath of the
Lord.</p>

<p>Before Constantine’s time, there is no trace of
the doctrine of the change of the Sabbath. On
the contrary, we have decisive evidence that
Sunday was a day on which ordinary labor was
considered lawful and proper. But Constantine,
while yet a heathen, commanded that every kind
of business excepting agriculture should be laid
aside on that day. His law designated the day as
a heathen festival, which it actually was. But
within four years after its enactment, Constantine
had become, not merely a professed convert
to the Christian religion, but, in many respects,
practically the head of the church, as the course
of things at the council of Nicea plainly showed.
His heathen Sunday law, being unrevoked, was
thenceforward enforced in behalf of that day as
a Christian festival. This law gave to the Sunday
festival, for the first time, something of a
Sabbatic character. It was now a rest-day from
most kinds of business by the law of the Roman
Empire. God’s rest-day was thenceforward more
in the way than ever before.</p>

<p>But now we come to a fact of remarkable interest.
The way having been prepared, as we
have just seen, for the doctrine of the change of
the Sabbath, and the circumstances of the case
demanding its production, it was at this very
point brought forward for the <i>first time</i>. Eusebius,
the special friend and flatterer of Constantine,
was the man who first put forth this doctrine.
In his “Commentary on the Psalms,” he makes
the following statement on Psalm xcii. respecting
the change of the Sabbath:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Wherefore as they [the Jews] rejected it [the Sabbath
law] the Word [Christ], by the new covenant, <span class="smcap">translated</span>
and <span class="smcap">transferred</span> the feast of the Sabbath to the
morning light, and gave us the symbol of true rest, viz.,
the saving Lord’s day, the first [day] of the light, in
which the Saviour of the world, after all his labors among
men, obtained the victory over death, and passed the
portals of Heaven, having achieved a work superior to
the six-days’ creation.”<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On this day, which is the first [day] of light and of
the true Sun, we assemble, after an interval of six days,
and celebrate holy and spiritual Sabbaths, even all nations
redeemed by him throughout the world, and do
those things according to the spiritual law, which were
decreed for the priests to do on the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And all things whatsoever that it was duty to do on
the Sabbath, these we have transferred to the Lord’s day,
as more appropriately belonging to it, because it has a
precedence and is first in rank, and more honorable than
the Jewish Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Eusebius was under the strongest temptation
to please and even to flatter Constantine; for he
lived in the sunshine of imperial favor. On one
occasion, he went so far as to say that the city of
Jerusalem, which Constantine had rebuilt, might
be the New Jerusalem predicted in the prophecies!<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
But perhaps there was no act of Eusebius
that could give Constantine greater pleasure than
his publication of such doctrine as this respecting
the change of the Sabbath. The emperor had,
by the civil law, given to Sunday a Sabbatical
character. Though he had done this while yet a
heathen, he found it to his interest to maintain
this law after he obtained a commanding position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
in the Catholic church. When, therefore, Eusebius
came out and declared that Christ transferred
the Sabbath to Sunday, a doctrine never
before heard of, and in support of which he had
no Scripture to quote, Constantine could not but
feel in the highest degree flattered that his own
Sabbatical edict pertained to the very day which
Christ had ordained to be the Sabbath in place
of the seventh. It was a convincing proof that
Constantine was divinely called to his high position
in the Catholic church, that he should thus
exactly identify his work with that of Christ,
though he had no knowledge at the time that
Christ had done any work of the kind.</p>

<p>As no writer before Eusebius had ever hinted
at the doctrine of the change of the Sabbath, and
as there is the most convincing proof, as we have
shown, that before his time Sunday possessed no
Sabbatic character, and as Eusebius does not
claim that this doctrine is asserted in the Scriptures,
nor in any preceding ecclesiastical writer,
it is certain that he was the father of the doctrine.
This new doctrine was not put forth
without some motive. That motive could not
have been to bring forward some neglected passages
of the Scriptures; for he does not quote
a single text in its support. But the circumstances
of the case plainly reveal the motive. The
new doctrine was exactly adapted to the new order
of things introduced by Constantine. It was,
moreover, peculiarly suited to flatter that emperor’s
pride, the very thing which Eusebius was
under the strongest temptation to do.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, however, that Eusebius, in
the very connection in which he announces this
new doctrine, unwittingly exposes its falsity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
He first asserts that Christ changed the Sabbath,
and then virtually contradicts it by indicating
the real authors of the change. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All things whatsoever that it was duty to do on the
Sabbath, these <span class="smcap">we</span> have transferred to the Lord’s day.”<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The persons here referred to as the authors of
this work are the Emperor Constantine, and such
bishops as Eusebius, who loved the favor of
princes, and Sylvester, the pretended successor
of Saint Peter. Two facts refute the assertion of
Eusebius that Christ changed the Sabbath: 1.
That Eusebius, who lived three hundred years
after the alleged change, is the first man who
mentions such change; 2. That Eusebius testifies
that himself and others made this change, which
they could not have done had Christ made it at
the beginning. But though the doctrine of the
change of the Sabbath was thus announced by
Eusebius, it was not seconded by any writer of
that age. The doctrine had never been heard of
before, and Eusebius had simply his own assertion,
but no passage of the Holy Scriptures to
offer in its support.</p>

<p>But after Constantine, the Sabbath began to
recover strength, at least in the eastern churches.
Prof. Stuart, in speaking of the period from
Constantine to the council of Laodicea, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 364,
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The practice of it [the keeping of the Sabbath] was
continued by Christians who were jealous for the honor
of the Mosaic law, and finally became, as we have seen,
predominant throughout Christendom. It was supposed
at length that the fourth commandment did require the
observance of the seventh-day Sabbath (not merely a seventh
part of time), and reasoning as Christians of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
present day are wont to do, viz., that <i>all</i> which belonged
to the ten commandments was immutable and perpetual,
the churches in general came gradually to regard the seventh-day
Sabbath as altogether sacred.”<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Prof. Stuart, however, connects with this the
statement that Sunday was honored by all parties.
But the council of Laodicea struck a heavy
blow at this Sabbath-keeping in the eastern
church. Thus Mr. James, in addressing the
University of Oxford, bears witness:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When the practice of keeping Saturday Sabbaths,
which had become so general at the close of this century,
was evidently gaining ground in the eastern church, a decree
was passed in the council held at Laodicea [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
364] ‘that members of the church should not rest from
work on the Sabbath like Jews, but should labor on that
day, and preferring in honor the Lord’s day, then if it
be in their power should rest from work as Christians.’”<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This shows conclusively that at that period
the observance of the Sabbath according to the
commandment was extensive in the eastern
churches. But the Laodicean council, not only
forbade the observance of the Sabbath, they even
pronounced a curse on those who should obey the
fourth commandment! Prynne thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is certain that Christ himself, his apostles, and the
primitive Christians for some good space of time, did constantly
observe the seventh-day Sabbath; ... the evangelists
and St. Luke in the Acts ever styling it the Sabbath
day, ... and making mention of its ... solemnization
by the apostles and other Christians, ... it being still
solemnized by many Christians after the apostles’ times,
even till the council of Laodicea [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 364], as ecclesiastical
writers and the twenty-ninth canon of that council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
testify, which runs thus:<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> ‘Because Christians ought not
to Judaize, and to rest in the Sabbath, but to work in that
day (which many did refuse at that time to do). But preferring
in honor the Lord’s day (there being then a great controversy
among Christians which of these two days ...
should have precedency) if they desired to rest they should
do this as Christians. Wherefore if they shall be found
to Judaize, let them be accursed from Christ.’... The
seventh-day Sabbath was ... solemnized by Christ, the
apostles and primitive Christians, till the Laodicean council
did in a manner quite abolish the observation of it....
The council of Laodicea [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 364] ... first settled
the observation of the Lord’s day, and prohibited
... the keeping of the Jewish Sabbath under an anathema.”<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The action of this council did not extirpate
the Sabbath from the eastern churches, though it
did materially weaken its influence, and cause its
observance to become with many only a nominal
thing, while it did most effectually enhance the
sacredness and the authority of the Sunday festival.
That it did not wholly extinguish Sabbath-keeping
is thus certified by an old English
writer, John Ley:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From the apostles’ time until the council of Laodicea,
which was about the year 364, the holy observation of the
Jews’ Sabbath continued, as may be proved out of many
authors; yea, notwithstanding the decree of that council
against it.”<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
372, uses this expostulation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With what eyes can you behold the Lord’s day, when
you despise the Sabbath? Do you not perceive that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
they are sisters, and that in slighting the one, you affront
the other?”<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This testimony is valuable in that it marks
the progress of apostasy concerning the Sabbath.
The Sunday festival entered the church, not as a
divine institution, but as a voluntary observance.
Even as late as <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 200, Tertullian said that it
had only tradition and custom in its support.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p>But in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 372, this human festival had become
the sister and equal of that day which God
hallowed in the beginning and solemnly commanded
in the moral law. How worthy to be
called the sister of the Sabbath the Sunday festival
actually was, may be judged from what followed.
When this self-styled sister had gained
an acknowledged position in the family, she expelled
the other, and trampled her in the dust.
In our days, the Sunday festival claims to be the
very day intended in the fourth commandment.</p>

<p>The following testimonies exhibit the authority
of church councils in its true light. Jortin is
quoted by Cox as saying:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In such assemblies, the best and the most moderate
men seldom have the ascendant, and they are often led
or driven by others who are far inferior to them in good
qualities.”<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same writer gives us Baxter’s opinion
of the famous Westminster Assembly. Baxter
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have lived to see an assembly of ministers, where
three or four leading men were so prevalent as to form a
confession in the name of the whole party, which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
that in it which particular members did disown. And
when about a controverted article, one man hath charged
me deeply with questioning the words of the church,
others, who were at the forming of that article have laid
it all on that same man, the rest being loth to strive
much against him; and so it was he himself was the
church whose authority he so much urged.”<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such has been the nature of councils in all
ages; yet they have ever claimed infallibility,
and have largely used that infallibility in the
suppression of the Sabbath and the establishment
of the festival of Sunday. Of first-day sacredness
prior to, and as late as, the time of Chrysostom,
Kitto thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though in later times we find considerable reference
to a sort of <i>consecration of the day</i>, it does not seem at any
period of the ancient church to have assumed the form of
such an observance as some modern religious communities
have contended for. Nor do these writers in any instance
pretend to allege <i>any divine command, or even apostolic
practice</i>, in support of it.... Chrysostom (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 360)
concludes one of his Homilies by dismissing his audience
to their respective ordinary occupations.”<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was reserved for modern theologians to discover
the divine or apostolic authority for Sunday
observance. The ancient doctors of the church
were unaware that any such authority existed;
and hence they deemed it lawful and proper to
engage in usual worldly business on that day
when their religious worship was concluded.
Thus, Heylyn bears witness concerning St.
Chrysostom that he</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Confessed it to be lawful for a man to look unto his
worldly business on the Lord’s day, after the congregation
was dismissed.”<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span></p>

<p>St. Jerome, a few years after this, at the opening
of the fifth century, in his commendation of
the lady Paula, shows his own opinion of Sunday
labor. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Paula, with the women, as soon as they returned
home on the Lord’s day, they sat down severally to their
work, and made clothes for themselves and others.”<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Morer justifies this Sunday labor in the following
terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If we read they did any work on the Lord’s day, it
is to be remembered that this application to their daily
tasks was not till their worship was quite over, when they
might with innocency enough resume them, because the
length of time or the number of hours assigned for piety
was not then so well explained as in after ages. The
state of the church is vastly different from what it was in
those early days. Christians then for some centuries of
years were under persecution and poverty; and besides
their own wants, they had many of them severe masters
who compelled them to work, and made them bestow
less time in spiritual matters than they otherwise would.
In St. Jerome’s age their condition was better, because
Christianity had got into the throne as well as into the
empire. Yet for all this, the entire sanctification of the
Lord’s day proceeded slowly: and that it was the work
of time to bring it to perfection, appears from the several
steps the church made in her constitutions, and from the
decrees of emperors and other princes, wherein the prohibitions
from servile and civil business advanced by
degrees from one species to another, till the day had got
a considerable figure in the world. Now, therefore, the
case being so much altered, the most proper use of citing
those old examples is only, in point of doctrine, to show
that ordinary work, as being a compliance with providence
for the support of natural life, is not sinful even on
the Lord’s day, when necessity is loud, and the laws of
that church and nation where we live are not against it.
This is what the first Christians had to say for themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
in the works they did on that day. And if those works
had been then judged a prophanation of the festival, I
dare believe, they would have suffered martyrdom rather
than been guilty.”<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The bishop of Ely thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In St Jerome’s days, and in the very place where he
was residing, the devoutest Christians did ordinarily work
upon the Lord’s day, when the service of the church was
ended.”<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

</div>

<p>St. Augustine, the cotemporary of Jerome,
gives a synopsis of the argument in that age for
Sunday observance, in the following words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appears from the sacred Scriptures, that this day
was a solemn one; it was the first day of the age, that is
of the existence of our world; in it the elements of the
world were formed; on it the angels were created; on it
Christ rose also from the dead; on it the Holy Spirit descended
from Heaven upon the apostles as manna had
done in the wilderness. For these and other such circumstances
the Lord’s day is distinguished; and therefore
the holy doctors of the church have decreed that all
the glory of the Jewish Sabbath is transferred to it. Let
us therefore keep the Lord’s day as the ancients were
commanded to do the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is to be observed that Augustine does not
assign among his reasons for first-day observance,
the change of the Sabbath by Christ or his apostles,
or that the apostles observed that day, or
that John had given it the name of Lord’s day.
These modern first-day arguments were unknown
to Augustine. He gave the credit of the work,
not to Christ or his inspired apostles, but to the
holy doctors of the church, who, of their own accord,
had transferred the glory of the ancient
Sabbath to the venerable day of the sun. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
first day of the week was considered in the fifth
century the most proper day for giving holy orders,
that is, for ordinations, and about the middle
of this century, says Heylyn,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A law [was] made by Leo then Pope of Rome, and
generally since taken up in the western church, that they
should be conferred upon no day else.”<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

</div>

<p>According to Dr. Justin Edwards, this same
pope made also this decree in behalf of Sunday:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">We ordain</span>, according to the true meaning of the
Holy Ghost, and of the apostles as thereby directed, that
on the sacred day wherein our own integrity was restored,
all do rest and cease from labor.”<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Soon after this edict of the pope, the emperor
Leo, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 469, put forth the following decree:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is our will and pleasure, that the holy days dedicated
to the most high God, should not be spent in sensual
recreations, or otherwise prophaned by suits of law,
especially the Lord’s day, which we decree to be a venerable
day, and therefore free it of all citations, executions,
pleadings, and the like avocations. Let not the circus or
theater be opened, nor combating with wild beasts be
seen on it.... If any will presume to offend in the
premises, if he be a military man, let him lose his commission;
or if other, let his estate or goods be confiscated.”<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And this emperor determined to mend the
breach in Constantine’s law, and thus prohibit
agriculture on Sunday. So he adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We command therefore all, as well husbandmen as
others, to forbear work on this day of our restoration.”<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The holy doctors of the church had by this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
time very effectually despoiled the Sabbath of its
glory, transferring it to the Lord’s day of Pope
Sylvester; as Augustine testifies; yet was not
Sabbatical observance wholly extinguished even
in the Catholic church. The historian Socrates,
who wrote about the middle of the fifth century,
thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For although almost all churches throughout the
world celebrate the sacred mysteries on the Sabbath of
every week, yet the Christians of Alexandria and at
Rome, on account of some ancient tradition, refuse to do
this. The Egyptians in the neighborhood of Alexandria,
and the inhabitants of Thebais, hold their religious meetings
on the Sabbath, but do not participate of the mysteries
in the manner usual among Christians in general—for
after having eaten and satisfied themselves with food
of all kinds, in the evening, making their oblations, they
partake of the mysteries.”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As the church of Rome had turned the Sabbath
into a fast some two hundred years before
this, in order to oppose its observance, it is probable
that this was the ancient tradition referred
to by Socrates. And Sozomen, the cotemporary
of Socrates, speaks on the same point as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The people of Constantinople, and of several other
cities, assemble together on the Sabbath, as well as on
the next day; which custom is never observed at Rome,
or at Alexandria. There are several cities and villages in
Egypt where, contrary to the usages established elsewhere,
the people meet together on Sabbath evenings;
and although they have dined previously, partake of the
mysteries.”<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the statement of these historians, Cox remarks:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was their practice to Sabbatize on Saturday, and to
celebrate Sunday as a day of rejoicing and festivity.
While, however, in some places a respect was thus generally
paid to both of these days, the Judaizing practice
of observing Saturday was by the leading churches expressly
condemned, and all the doctrines connected with
it steadfastly resisted.”—<i>Sabbath Laws</i>, p. 280.</p>

</div>

<p>The time had now come, when, as stated by
Coleman, the observance of the Sabbath was
deemed heretical; and the close of the fifth century
witnessed its effectual suppression in the
great body of the Catholic church.</p>

</div>

<p>The opening of the sixth century witnessed
the development of the great apostasy to such an
extent that the man of sin might be plainly seen
sitting in the temple of God.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> The western Roman
Empire had been broken up into ten kingdoms,
and the way was now prepared for the
work of the little horn.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> In the early part of this
century, the bishop of Rome was made head over
the entire church by the emperor of the east,
Justinian.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> The dragon gave unto the beast his
power, and his seat, and great authority. From
this accession to supremacy by the Roman pontiff,
date the “time, times, and dividing of time,”
or twelve hundred and sixty years of the prophecies
of Daniel and John.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></p>

<p>The true people of God now retired for safety
into places of obscurity and seclusion, as represented
by the prophecy: “The woman fled into
the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
of God, that they should feed her there a thousand
two hundred and threescore days.”<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> Leaving
their history for the present, let us follow
that of the Catholic church, and trace in its record
the history of the Sunday festival through
the period of the Dark Ages. Of the fifth and
sixth centuries, Heylyn bears the following testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The faithful being united better than before, became
more uniform in matters of devotion; and in that uniformity
did agree together to give the Lord’s day all the
honors of an holy festival. Yet was not this done all at
once, but by degrees; the fifth and sixth centuries being
well-nigh spent before it came into that height which
hath since continued. The emperors and the prelates in
these times had the same affections; both [being] earnest
to advance this day above all other; and to the
edicts of the one and ecclesiastical constitutions of the
other, it stands indebted for many of those privileges and
exemptions which it still enjoyeth.”<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But Sunday had not yet acquired the title of
Sabbath. Thus Brerewood bears testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The name of the Sabbath remained appropriated to
the old Sabbath; and was never attributed to the Lord’s
day, not of many hundred years after our Saviour’s time.”<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Heylyn says of the term Sabbath in the
ancient church:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Saturday is called amongst them by no other
name than that which formerly it had, the <i>Sabbath</i>. So
that whenever for a thousand years and upwards, we
meet with <i>Sabbatum</i> in any writer of what name soever,
it must be understood of no day but <i>Saturday</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Francis White, bishop of Ely, also testifies:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When the ancient fathers distinguish and give proper
names to the particular days of the week, they always
style the Saturday, <i>Sabbatum</i>, the Sabbath, and the Sunday,
or first day of the week, <i>Dominicum</i>, the Lord’s
day.”<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It should be observed, however, that the earliest
mention of Sunday as the Lord’s day, is in
the writings of Tertullian; Justin Martyr, some
sixty years before, styling it “the day called Sunday;”
while the authoritative application of that
term to Sunday was by Sylvester, bishop of
Rome, more than one hundred years after the
time of Tertullian. The earliest mention of Sunday
as Christian Sabbath is thus noted by Heylyn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first who ever used it to denote the Lord’s day
(the first that I have met with in all this search) is one
Petrus Alfonsus—he lived about the time that Rupertus
did—[which was the beginning of the twelfth century]
who calls the Lord’s day by the name of Christian Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of Sunday labor in the eastern church, Heylyn
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was near nine hundred years from our Saviour’s
birth if not quite so much, before restraint of husbandry
on this day had been first thought of in the east; and
probably being thus restrained did find no more obedience
there than it had done before in the western parts.”<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of Sunday labor in the western church, Dr.
Francis White thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Catholic church for more than six hundred years
after Christ, permitted labor, and gave license to many
Christian people to work upon the Lord’s day, at such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
hours as they were not commanded to be present at the
public service by the precept of the church.”<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But let us trace the several steps by which the
festival of Sunday increased in strength until it
attained its complete development. These will
be found at present mostly in the edicts of emperors,
and the decrees of councils. Morer tells
us that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Under Clodoveus king of France met the bishops in
the first council of Orleans [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 507], where they obliged
themselves and their successors, to be always at the
church on the Lord’s day, except in case of sickness or
some great infirmity. And because they, with some other
of the clergy in those days, took cognizance of judicial
matters, therefore by a council at Arragon, about the
year 518 in the reign of Theodorick, king of the Goths, it
was decreed that ‘No bishop or other person in holy orders
should examine or pass judgment in any civil controversy
on the Lord’s day.’”<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This shows that civil courts were sometimes
held on Sunday by the bishops in those days;
otherwise such a prohibition would not have
been put forth. Hengstenberg, in his notice of
the third council of Orleans, gives us an insight
into the then existing state of the Sunday festival:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The third council of Orleans, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 538, says in its
twenty-ninth canon: ‘The opinion is spreading amongst
the people, that it is wrong to ride, or drive, or cook food,
or do anything to the house, or the person on the Sunday.
But since such opinions are more Jewish than
Christian, that shall be lawful in future, which has been
so to the present time. On the other hand agricultural
labor ought to be laid aside, <i>in order that the people may
not be prevented from attending church</i>.’”<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span></p>

<p>Observe the reason assigned. It is not lest
they violate the law of the Sabbath, but it is that
they may not be kept from church. Another
authority states the case thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Labor in the country [on Sunday] was not prohibited
till the council of Orleans, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 538. It was thus an institution
of the church, as Dr. Paley has remarked. The
earlier Christians met in the morning of that day for
prayer and singing hymns in commemoration of Christ’s
resurrection, and then went about their usual duties.”<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 588, another council was holden, the
occasion of which is thus stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And because, notwithstanding all this care, the day
was not duly observed, the bishops were again summoned
to Mascon, a town in Burgundy, by King Gunthrum, and
there they framed this canon: ‘Notice is taken that
Christian people, very much neglect and slight the Lord’s
day, giving themselves as on other days to common work,
to redress which irreverence, for the future, we warn every
Christian who bears not that name in vain, to give
ear to our advice, knowing we have a concern on us for
your good, and a power to hinder you to do evil. Keep
then the Lord’s day, the day of our new birth.’”<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Further legislation being necessary, we are
told:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“About a year forward, there was a council at Narbon,
which forbid all persons of what country or quality soever,
to do any servile work on the Lord’s day. But if
any man presumed to disobey this canon he was to be
fined if a freeman, and if a servant, severely lashed. Or as
Surius represents the penalty in the edict of King Recaredus,
which he put out, near the same time to strengthen
the decrees of the council, ‘Rich men were to be punished
with the loss of a moiety of their estates, and the poorer
sort with perpetual banishment,’ in the year of grace 590.
Another synod was held at Auxerre a city in Champain, in
the reign of Clotair king of France, where it was decreed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
... ‘that no man should be allowed to plow, nor
cart, or do any such thing on the Lord’s day.’”<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such were some of the efforts made in the
sixth century to advance the sacredness of the
Sunday festival. And Morer tells us that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For fear the doctrine should not take without miracles
to support it, Gregory of Tours [about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 590]
furnishes us with several to that purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Francis West, an English first-day writer,
gravely adduces one of these miracles in support
of first-day sacredness:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Gregory of Tours reporteth, ‘that a husbandman,
who upon the Lord’s day went to plough his field, as he
cleansed his plough with an iron, the iron stuck so fast
in his hand that for two years he could not be delivered
from it, but carried it about continually, to his exceeding
great pain and shame.’”<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the conclusion of the sixth century, Pope
Gregory exhorted the people of Rome to “expiate
on the day of our Lord’s resurrection what was
remissly done for the six days before.”<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> In the
same epistle, this pope condemned a class of men
at Rome who advocated the strict observance of
both the Sabbath and the Sunday, styling them
the preachers of Antichrist.<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> This shows the intolerant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
feeling of the papacy toward the Sabbath,
even when joined with the strict observance
of Sunday. It also shows that there were Sabbath-keepers
even in Rome itself as late as the
seventh century; although so far bewildered by
the prevailing darkness that they joined with its
observance a strict abstinence from labor on
Sunday.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventh century arose
another foe to the Bible Sabbath in the person of
Mahomet. To distinguish his followers alike from
those who observed the Sabbath and those who
observed the festival of Sunday, he selected Friday,
the sixth day of the week, as their religious
festival. And thus “the Mahometans and the
Romanists crucified the Sabbath, as the Jews
and the Romans did the Lord of the Sabbath, between
two thieves, the sixth and first day of the
week.”<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> For Mahometanism and Romanism
each suppressed the Sabbath over a wide extent
of territory. About the middle of the seventh
century, we have further canons of the church in
behalf of Sunday:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At Chalons, a city in Burgundy, about the year 654,
there was a provincial synod which confirmed what had
been done by the third council of Orleans, about the observation
of the Lord’s day, namely that ‘none should
plow or reap, or do any other thing belonging to husbandry,
on pain of the censures of the church; which was
the more minded, because backed with the secular power,
and by an edict menacing such as offended herein; who if
bondmen, were to be soundly beaten, but if free, had three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
admonitions, and then if faulty, lost the third part of
their patrimony, and if still obstinate were made slaves
for the future. And in the first year of Eringius, about
the time of Pope Agatho there sat the twelfth council of
Toledo in Spain, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 681, where the Jews were forbid
to keep their own festivals, but so far at least observe the
Lord’s day as to do no manner of work on it, whereby
they might express their contempt of Christ or his worship.’”<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These were weighty reasons indeed for Sunday
observance. Nor can it be thought strange that
in the Dark Ages a constant succession of such
things should eventuate in the universal observance
of that day. Even the Jews were to be
compelled to desist from Sabbath observance,
and to honor Sunday by resting on that day
from their labor. The earliest mention of Sunday
in English statutes appears to be the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 692. “Ina, king of the west Saxons, by the advice
of Cenred his father, and Heddes and Erkenwald his
bishops, with all his aldermen and sages, in a great assembly
of the servants of God, for the health of their
souls, and common preservation of the kingdom, made
several constitutions, of which this was the third: ‘If a
servant do any work on Sunday by his master’s order,
he shall be free, and the master pay thirty shillings; but
if he went to work on his own head, he shall be either
beaten with stripes, or ransom himself with a price. A
freeman, if he works on this day, shall lose his freedom
or pay sixty shillings; if he be a priest, double.’”<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same year that this law was enacted in
England, the sixth general council convened at
Constantinople, which decreed that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any bishop or other clergyman, or any of the laity,
absented himself from the church three Sundays together,
except in cases of very great necessity, if a clergyman, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
was to be deposed; if a layman, debarred the holy communion.”<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the year 747, a council of the English clergy
was called under Cuthbert, archbishop of Canterbury,
in the reign of Egbert, king of Kent, and
this constitution made:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is ordered that the Lord’s day be celebrated with
due veneration, and wholly devoted to the worship of
God. And that all abbots and priests, on this most holy
day, remain in their respective monasteries and churches,
and there do their duty according to their places.”<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another ecclesiastical statute of the eighth
century was enacted at Dingosolinum in Bavaria,
where a synod met about 772 which decreed that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If any man shall work his cart on this day, or do any
such common business, his team shall be presently forfeited
to the public use, and if the party persists in his folly, let
him be sold for a bondman.”<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The English were not behind their neighbors
in the good work of establishing the sacredness
of Sunday. Thus we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 784. “Egbert, archbishop of York, to show
positively what was to be done on Sundays, and what the
laws designed by prohibiting ordinary work to be done on
such days, made this canon: ‘Let nothing else, saith he,
be done on the Lord’s day, but to attend on God in hymns
and psalms and spiritual songs. Whoever marries on
Sunday, let him do penance for seven days.’”<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the conclusion of the eighth century, further
efforts were made in behalf of this favored
day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Charles the Great summoned the bishops to Friuli,
in Italy, where ... they decreed [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 791] that all
people should, with due reverence and devotion, honor the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
Lord’s day.... Under the same prince another
council was called three years later at Frankford in Germany,
and there the limits of the Lord’s day were determined
from Saturday evening to Sunday evening.”<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The five councils of Mentz, Rheims, Tours,
Chalons, and Arles, were all called in the year
813 by Charlemagne. It would be too irksome to
the reader to dwell upon the several acts of these
councils in behalf of Sunday. They are of the
same character as those already quoted. The
council of Chalons, however, is worthy of being
noticed in that, according to Morer,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They entreated the help of the secular power, and desired
the emperor [Charlemagne] to provide for the stricter
observation of it [Sunday]. Which he accordingly did,
and left no stone unturned to secure the honor of the
day. His care succeeded; and during his reign, the
Lord’s day bore a considerable figure. But after his day,
it put on another face.”<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The pope lent a helping hand in checking the
profanation of Sunday:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And thereupon Pope Eugenius, in a synod held at
Rome about 826, ... gave directions that the parish
priest should admonish such offenders and wish them to
go to church and say their prayers, lest otherwise they
might bring some great calamity on themselves and
neighbors.”<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

</div>

<p>All this, however, was not sufficient, and so
another council was summoned. At this council
was brought forward—perhaps for the first time—the
famous first-day argument now so familiar
to all, that Sunday is proved to be the true Sabbath
because that men are struck by lightning
who labor on that day. Thus we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But these paternal admonitions turning to little account,
a provincial council was held at Paris three years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
after ... in 829, wherein the prelates complain that
‘The Lord’s day was not kept with reverence as became
religion ... which was the reason that God had sent
several judgments on them, and in a very remarkable
manner punished some people for slighting and abusing
it. For, say they, many of us by our own knowledge,
and some by hearsay know, that several countrymen following
their husbandry on this day have been killed with
lightning, others, being seized with convulsions in their
joints, have miserably perished. Whereby it is apparent
how high the displeasure of God was upon their neglect of
this day.’ And at last they conclude that ‘in the first place
the priests and ministers, then kings and princes, and all
faithful people be beseeched to use their utmost endeavors
and care that the day be restored to its honor, and for
the credit of Christianity more devoutly observed for the
time to come.’”<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Further legislation being necessary,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was decreed about seven years after in a council
at Aken, under Lewis the Godly, that neither pleadings
nor marriages should be allowed on the Lord’s day.”<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But the law of Charlemagne, though backed
with the authority of the church, as expressed in
the canons of the councils already quoted, by the
remissness of Lewis, his successor became very
feeble. It is evident that canons and decrees of
councils, though fortified with the mention of
terrible judgments that had befallen transgressors,
were not yet sufficient to enforce the sacred day.
Another and more terrific statute than any yet
issued was sought at the hands of the emperor.
Thus we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thereupon an address was made to the emperors,
Lewis and Lotharius, that they would be pleased to take
some care in it, and send out some precept or injunction
more severe than what was hitherto extant, to strike
terror into their subjects, and force them to forbear their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
ploughing, pleading, and marketing, then grown again
into use; which was done about the year 853; and to
that end a synod was called at Rome under the popedom
of Leo IV.”<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The advocates of the first-day Sabbath have in
all ages sought for a law capable of striking terror
into those who do not hallow that day. They
still continue the vain endeavor. But if they
would honor the day which God set apart for
the Sabbath, they would find in that law of fire
which proceeded from his right hand a statute
which renders all human legislation entirely unnecessary.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p>At this synod the pope took the matter in
hand in good earnest. Thus Heylyn testifies that
under the emperors, Lewis and Lotharius, a synod
was held at Rome <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 853, under pope Leo IV.,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Where it was ordered more precisely than in former
times that no man should from thenceforth dare to make
any markets on the Lord’s day, no, not for things that
were to eat: neither to do any kind of work that belonged
to husbandry. Which canon being made at Rome, confirmed
at Compeigne, and afterwards incorporated as it
was into the body of the canon law, became to be admitted,
without further question, in most parts of Christendom;
especially when the popes had attained their height,
and brought all Christian princes to be at their devotion.
For then the people, who before had most opposed it,
might have justly said, ‘Behold two kings stood not before
him, how then shall we stand?’ Out of which consternation
all men presently obeyed, tradesmen of all
sorts being brought to lay by their labors; and amongst
those, the miller, though his work was easiest, and least
of all required his presence.”<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This was a most effectual establishment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
first-day sacredness. Five years after this we
read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 858. “The Bulgarians sent some questions to
Pope Nicholas, to which they desired answers. And that
[answer] which concerned the Lord’s day was that they
should desist from all secular work, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Morer informs us respecting the civil power,
that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this century the emperor [of Constantinople] Leo,
surnamed the philosopher, restrained the works of husbandry,
which, according to Constantine’s toleration,
were permitted in the east. The same care was taken in
the west, by Theodorius, king of the Bavarians, who made
this order, that ‘If any person on the Lord’s day yoked
his oxen, or drove his wain, his right-side ox should be
forthwith forfeited; or if he made hay and carried it in,
he was to be twice admonished to desist, which if he did
not, he was to receive no less than fifty stripes.’”<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of Sunday laws in England in this century, we
read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 876. “Alfred the Great, was the first who
united the Saxon Heptarchy, and it was not the least
part of his care to make a law that among other festivals
this day more especially might be solemnly kept, because
it was the day whereon our Saviour Christ overcame the
devil; meaning Sunday, which is the weekly memorial of
our Lord’s resurrection, whereby he overcame death, and
him who had the power of death, that is the devil. And
whereas before the single punishment for sacrilege committed
on any other day, was to restore the value of the
thing stolen, and withal lose one hand, he added that if
any person was found guilty of this crime done on the
Lord’s day, he should be doubly punished.”<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nineteen years later, the pope and his council
still further strengthened the sacred day. The
council of Friburgh in Germany, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 895, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
Pope Formosus, decreed that the Lord’s day,
men “were to spend in prayers, and devote
wholly to the service of God, who otherwise
might be provoked to anger.”<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> The work of
establishing Sunday sacredness in England was
carried steadily forward:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“King Athelston, ... in the year 928, made a law that
there should be no marketing or civil pleadings on the
Lord’s day, under the penalty of forfeiting the commodity,
besides a fine of thirty shillings for each offense.”<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In a convocation of the English clergy about
this time, it was decreed that all sorts of traffic
and the holding of courts, &amp;c., on Sunday should
cease. “And whoever transgressed in any of
these instances, if a freeman, he was to pay twelve
oræ, if a servant, be severely whipt.” We are
further informed that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“About the year 943, Otho, archbishop of Canterbury,
had it decreed that above all things the Lord’s day should
be kept with all imaginable caution, according to the canon
and ancient practice.”<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 967. King Edgar “commanded that the festival
should be kept from three of the clock in the afternoon on
Saturday, till day-break on Monday.”<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“King Ethelred the younger, son of Edgar, coming
to the crown about the year 1009, called a general council
of all the English clergy, under Elfeagus, archbishop of
Canterbury, and Wolstan, archbishop of York. And
there it was required that all persons in a more zealous
manner should observe the Sunday, and what belonged
to it.”<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor did the Sunday festival fail to gain a footing
in Norway. Heylyn tells us of the piety of
a Norwegian king by the name of Olaus, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
1028.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For being taken up one Sunday in some serious
thoughts, and having in his hand a small walking stick,
he took his knife and whittled it as men do sometimes,
when their minds are troubled or intent on business.
And when it had been told him as by way of jest how he
had trespassed therein against the Sabbath, he gathered
the small chips together, put them upon his hand, and
set fire unto them, that so, saith Crantzius, he might revenge
that on himself what unawares he had committed
against God’s commandment.”<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In Spain also the work went forward. A council
was held at Coy, in Spain, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1050, under
Ferdinand, king of Castile, in the days of Pope
Leo IX., where it was decreed that the Lord’s day
“was to be entirely consecrated to hearing of
mass.”<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>To strengthen the sacredness of this venerable
day in the minds of the people, the doctors of the
church were not wanting. Heylyn makes the
following statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was delivered of the souls in purgatory by Petrus
Damiani, who lived <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1056, that every Lord’s day
they were manumitted from their pains and fluttered up
and down the lake Avernus, in the shape of birds.”<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At the same time, another argument of a similar
kind was brought forward to render the observance
still more strict. Morer informs us
respecting that class who in this age were most
zealous advocates of Sunday observance:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Yet still the others went on in their way; and to induce
their proselytes to spend the day with greater exactness
and care, they brought in the old argument of compassion
and charity to the damned in hell, who during
the day, have some respite from their torments, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
ease and liberty they have is more or less according to
the zeal and degrees of keeping it well.”<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If therefore they would strictly observe this
sacred festival, their friends in hell would reap
the benefit, in a respite from their torments on
that day! In a council at Rome, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1078, Pope
Gregory VII. decreed that as the Sabbath had
been long regarded as a fast day, those who desired
to be Christians should on that day abstain
from eating meat.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> In the eastern division of
the Catholic church, in the eleventh century, the
Sabbath was still regarded as a festival, equal in
sacredness with Sunday. Heylyn contrasts with
this the action of the western division of that
church:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But it was otherwise of old in the church of Rome,
where they did labor and fast.... And this, with little
opposition or interruption, save that which had been
made in the city of Rome in the beginning of the seventh
century, and was soon crushed by Gregory then bishop
there, as before we noted. And howsoever Urban of
that name the second, did consecrate it to the weekly
service of the blessed virgin, and instituted in the council
held at Clermont, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1095, that our lady’s office
should be said upon it, and that upon that day all Christian
folks should worship her with their best devotion.”<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It would seem that this was a crowning indignity
to the Most High. The memorial of the
great Creator was set apart as a festival on which
to worship Mary, under the title of mother of
God! In the middle of the twelfth century, the
king of England was admonished not to suffer
men to work upon Sunday. Henry II. entered
on the government about the year 1155.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of him it is reported that he had an apparition
at Cardiff (... in South Wales) which from St. Peter
charged him, that upon Sundays throughout his dominions,
there should be no buying or selling, and no servile
work done.”<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The sacredness of Sunday was not yet sufficiently
established, because a divine warrant for
its observance was still unprovided. The manner
in which this urgent necessity was met is
related by Roger Hoveden, a historian of high
repute who lived at the very time when this
much-needed precept was furnished by the pope.
Hoveden informs us that Eustace the abbot of
Flaye in Normandy, came into England in the
year 1200, to preach the word of the Lord, and
that his preaching was attended by many wonderful
miracles. He was very earnest in behalf
of Sunday. Thus Hoveden says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At London also, and many other places throughout
England, he effected by his preaching, that from that
time forward people did not dare to hold market of things
exposed for sale on the Lord’s Day.”<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But Hoveden tells us that “the enemy of mankind
raised against this man of God the ministers
of iniquity,” and it seems that having no
commandment for Sunday he was in a strait
place. The historian continues:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“However, the said abbot, on being censured by the
ministers of Satan, was unwilling any longer to molest
the prelates of England by his preaching, but returned to
Normandy, unto his place whence he came.”<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But Eustace, though repulsed, had no thought
of abandoning the contest. He had no commandment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
from the Lord when he came into
England the first time. But one year’s sojourn
on the continent was sufficient to provide that
which he lacked. Hoveden tells us how he returned
the following year with the needed precept:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the same year [1201], Eustace, abbot of Flaye,
returned to England, and preaching therein the word of
the Lord from city to city, and from place to place, forbade
any person to hold a market of goods on sale upon
the Lord’s day. For he said that the commandment
under-written, as to the observance of the Lord’s day,
had come down from Heaven:—</p>

<p class="center">“THE HOLY COMMANDMENT AS TO THE LORD’S DAY,</p>

<p>“Which came from Heaven to Jerusalem, and was
found upon the altar of Saint Simeon, in Golgotha,
where Christ was crucified for the sins of the world.
The Lord sent down this epistle, which was found upon
the altar of Saint Simeon, and after looking upon which,
three days and three nights, some men fell upon the
earth, imploring mercy of God. And after the third
hour, the patriarch arose, and Acharias, the archbishop,
and they opened the scroll, and received the holy epistle
from God. And when they had taken the same they
found this writing therein:—</p>

<p>“‘I am the Lord, who commanded you to observe the
holy day of the Lord, and ye have not kept it, and have
not repented of your sins, as I have said in my gospel,
“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall
not pass away.” Whereas, I caused to be preached unto
you repentance and amendment of life, you did not believe
me, I have sent against you the pagans, who have
shed your blood on the earth; and yet you have not believed;
and, because you did not keep the Lord’s day
holy, for a few days you suffered hunger, but soon I gave
you fullness, and after that you did still worse again.
Once more, it is my will, that no one, from the ninth
hour on Saturday until sunrise on Monday, shall do any
work except that which is good.</p>

<p>“‘And if any person shall do so, he shall with penance
make amends for the same. And if you do not pay obedience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
to this command, verily, I say unto you, and I
swear unto you, by my seat and by my throne, and by
the cherubim who watch my holy seat, that I will give
you my commands by no other epistle, but I will open
the heavens, and for rain I will rain upon you stones,
and wood, and hot water, in the night, that no one may
take precautions against the same, and that so I may destroy
all wicked men.</p>

<p>“‘This do I say unto you; for the Lord’s holy day, you
shall die the death, and for the other festivals of my
saints which you have not kept: I will send unto you
beasts that have the heads of lions, the hair of women,
the tails of camels, and they shall be so ravenous that
they shall devour your flesh, and you shall long to flee
away to the tombs of the dead, and to hide yourselves
for fear of the beasts; and I will take away the light of
the sun from before your eyes, and will send darkness
upon you, that not seeing, you may slay one another,
and that I may remove from you my face, and may not
show mercy upon you. For I will burn the bodies and
the hearts of you, and of all of those who do not keep
as holy the day of the Lord.</p>

<p>“‘Hear ye my voice, that so ye may not perish in the
land, for the holy day of the Lord. Depart from evil,
and show repentance for your sins. For, if you do not
do so, even as Sodom and Gomorrah shall you perish.
Now, know ye, that you are saved by the prayers of my
most holy mother, Mary, and of my most holy angels,
who pray for you daily. I have given unto you wheat
and wine in abundance, and for the same ye have
not obeyed me. For the widows and orphans cry unto
you daily, and unto them you show no mercy. The pagans
show mercy, but you show none at all. The trees
which bear fruit, I will cause to be dried up for your
sins; the rivers and the fountains shall not give water.</p>

<p>“‘I gave unto you a law in Mount Sinai, which you
have not kept. I gave you a law with mine own hands,
which you have not observed. For you I was born into
the world, and my festive day ye knew not. Being
wicked men, ye have not kept the Lord’s day of my resurrection.
By my right hand I swear unto you, that if
you do not observe the Lord’s day, and the festivals of
my saints, I will send unto you the pagan nations, that
they may slay you. And still do you attend to the business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
of others, and take no consideration of this? For
this will I send against you still worse beasts, who shall
devour the breasts of your women. I will curse those
who on the Lord’s day have wrought evil.</p>

<p>“‘Those who act unjustly towards their brethren, will
I curse. Those who judge unrighteously the poor and
the orphans upon the earth, will I curse. For me you
forsake, and you follow the prince of this world. Give
heed to my voice, and you shall have the blessing of
mercy. But you cease not from your bad works, nor
from the works of the devil. Because you are guilty of
perjuries and adulteries, therefore the nations shall surround
you, and shall, like beasts, devour you.’”<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That such a document was actually brought
into England at this time, and in the manner
here described, is so amply attested as to leave
no doubt.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Matthew Paris, like Hoveden, was
actually a cotemporary of Eustace. Hoveden
properly belongs to the twelfth century, for he
died shortly after the arrival of Eustace with his
roll. But Matthew Paris belongs to the thirteenth,
as he was but young at the time this roll
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1201) was brought into England. Both
have a high reputation for truthfulness. In
speaking of the writers of that century, Mosheim
bears the following testimony to the credibility
of Matthew Paris:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Among the historians, the <i>first place</i> is due to Matthew
Paris, a writer of the <i>highest merit</i>, both in point of
<i>knowledge</i> and <i>prudence</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span></p>

<p>And Dr. Murdock says of him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He is accounted the best historian of the Middle Ages,
learned, independent, honest, and judicious.”<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Matthew Paris relates the return of the abbot
Eustachius (as he spells the name) from Normandy,
and gives us a copy of the roll which he
brought, and an account of its fall from Heaven
as related by the abbot himself. He also tells us
how the abbot came by it, tracing the history of
the roll from the point when the patriarch gathered
courage to take it into his hands, till the
time when our abbot was commissioned to bring
it into England. Thus he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But when the patriarch and clergy of all the holy
land had diligently examined the contents of this epistle,
it was decreed in a general deliberation that the epistle
should be sent to the judgment of the Roman pontiff, seeing
that whatever he decreed to be done, would please all.
And when at length the epistle had come to the knowledge
of the lord pope, immediately he ordained heralds, who
being sent through different parts of the world, preached
every where the doctrine of this epistle, the Lord working
with them and confirming their words by signs following.
Among whom the abbot of Flay, Eustachius by name, a
devout and learned man, having entered the kingdom of
England did there shine with many miracles.”<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Now we know what the abbot was about during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
the year that he was absent from England.
He could not establish first-day sacredness by his
first mission to England, for he had no divine
warrant in its behalf. He therefore retired from
the mission long enough to make known the necessities
of the case to the “lord pope.” But when
he came the second time he brought the divine
mandate for Sunday, and with it the commission
of the pope, authorizing him to proclaim that
mandate to the people, and informing them that
it was sent to His Holiness from Jerusalem by
those who saw it fall from Heaven. Had Eustace
framed this document himself, and then forged a
commission from the pope, a few months would
have discovered the imposture. But their genuineness
was never questioned as is shown by the preservation
of this roll by the best historians of that
time. We therefore trace the responsibility for this
roll directly to the pope of Rome. The statement
of the pope that he received it from the hands of
those who saw it fall from Heaven is the guaranty
given by His Holiness to the people that the roll
came from God. The historians then living, who
record this transaction, were able to satisfy themselves
that Eustace brought the roll from the
pope; and they believed the pope’s statement
that he had received it from Heaven. It was Innocent
III. who filled the office of pope at this
time, of whom Bower speaks thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Innocent was perfectly well qualified to raise the papal
power and authority to the highest pitch, and we shall
see him improving, with great address, every opportunity
that offered to compass that end.”<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another eminent authority makes this statement:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The external circumstances of his time also furthered
Innocent’s views, and enabled him to make his pontificate
the most marked in the annals of Rome; the culminating
point of the temporal as well as the spiritual supremacy
of the Roman See.”<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“His pontificate may be fairly considered to have been
the period of the highest power of the Roman See.”<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The dense darkness of the Dark Ages still
covered the earth when that pontiff filled the
papal throne who raised the papacy to its highest
elevation. Two facts worthy of much thought
should here be named in connection:—</p>

<p>1. The first act of papal usurpation was by an
edict in behalf of Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p>2. The utmost hight of papal usurpation was
marked by the pope’s act of furnishing a divine
precept for Sunday observance.</p>

<p>The mission of Eustace was attested by miracles
which are worthy of perusal by those who
believe in first-day sacredness because their fathers
thus believed. Here they may learn what
was done six centuries since, to fix these ideas in
the minds of their fathers. Eustace came to
York, in the north of England, and, meeting an
honorable reception,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Preached the word of the Lord, and on the breaking
of the Lord’s day and the other festivals, and imposed
upon the people penance and gave absolution, upon condition
that in future they would pay due reverence to
the Lord’s day and the other festivals of the saints, doing
therein no servile work.”<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon this, the people who were dutiful to God at his
preaching, vowed before God that, for the future, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
Lord’s day, they would neither buy nor sell any thing,
unless, perchance, victuals and drink to wayfarers.”<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The abbot also made provision for the collection
of alms for the benefit of the poor, and forbade
the use of the churches for the sale of goods,
and for the pleading of causes. Upon this, the
king interfered as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Accordingly, through these and other warnings of
this holy man, the enemy of mankind being rendered envious,
he put it into the heart of the king and of the
princes of darkness to command that all who should observe
the before stated doctrines, and more especially all
those who had discountenanced the markets on the Lord’s
day, should be brought before the king’s court of justice,
to make satisfaction as to the observance of the Lord’s
day.”<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The markets on the Lord’s day, it seems, were
held in the churches, and Eustace was attempting
to suppress these when he forbade the sale of
goods in the churches. And now to confirm the authority
of the roll, and to neutralize the opposition
of the king, some very extraordinary prodigies
were reported. The roll forbade labor “from the
ninth hour (that is 3 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>) on Saturday until
sunrise on Monday.” Now read what happened
to the disobedient:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One Saturday, a certain carpenter of Beverly, who, after
the ninth hour of the day was, contrary to the wholesome
advice of his wife, making a wooden wedge, fell to the
earth, being struck with paralysis. A woman also, a
weaver, who, after the ninth hour, on Saturday, in her
anxiety to finish a part of the web, persisted in so doing,
fell to the ground, struck with paralysis, and lost her
voice. At Rafferton also, a vill belonging to Master
Roger Arundel, a man made for himself a loaf and baked
it under the ashes, after the ninth hour on Saturday, and
ate thereof, and put part of it by till the morning, but when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
he broke it on the Lord’s day blood started forth therefrom;
and he who saw it bore witness, and his testimony
is true.</p>

<p>“At Wakefield, also, one Saturday, while a miller was,
after the ninth hour, attending to grinding his corn, there
suddenly came forth, instead of flour, such a torrent of
blood, that the vessel placed beneath was nearly filled
with blood, and the mill-wheel stood immovable, in spite
of the strong rush of the water; and those who beheld
it wondered thereat, saying, ‘Spare us, O Lord, spare
thy people!’</p>

<p>“Also, in Lincolnshire a woman had prepared some
dough, and taking it to the oven after the ninth hour on
Saturday, she placed it in the oven, which was then at a
very great heat; but when she took it out, she found it
raw, on which she again put it into the oven, which was
very hot; and, both on the next day, and on Monday,
when she supposed that she should find the loaves baked,
she found raw dough.</p>

<p>“In the same county also, when a certain woman had
prepared her dough, intending to carry it to the oven, her
husband said to her, ‘It is Saturday, and it is now past
the ninth hour, put it one side till Monday;’ on which
the woman, obeying her husband, did as he commanded;
and so, having covered over the dough with a linen cloth,
on coming the next day to look at the dough, to see
whether it had not, in rising, through the yeast that was
in it, gone over the sides of the vessel, she found there
the loaves ready made by the divine will, and well baked,
without any fire of the material of this world. This was
a change wrought by the right hand of Him on high.”<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The historian laments that these miracles were
lost upon the people, and that they feared the
king more than they feared God, and so “like a
dog to his vomit, returned to the holding of
markets on the Lord’s day.”<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> Such was the first
attempt in England after the apparition of St.
Peter, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1155, to supply divine authority for
Sunday observance. “It shows,” as Morer quaintly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
observes, “how industrious men were in those
times to have this great day solemnly observed.”<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>
And Gilfillan, who has occasion to mention the
story of the roll from Heaven, has not one word
of condemnation for the pious fraud in behalf of
Sunday, but he simply speaks of our abbot as
“This ardent person.”<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p>Two years after the arrival of Eustace in England
with his roll, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1203, a council was held
in Scotland concerning the introduction and
establishment of the Lord’s day in that kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>
The roll that had fallen from Heaven to supply
the lack of scriptural testimony in behalf of this
day, was admirably adapted to the business of
this council, though Dr. Heylyn informs us that
the Scotch were so ready to comply with the
pope’s wishes that the packet from the court of
Heaven and the accompanying miracles were not
needed.<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> Yet Morer asserts that the packet was
actually produced on this occasion:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To that end it was again produced and read in a
council of Scotland, held under [pope] Innocent III., ...
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1203, in the reign of King William, who ... passed
it into a law that Saturday from twelve at noon ought to
be accounted holy, and that no man shall deal in such
worldly business as on feast days were forbidden. As
also that at the tolling of a bell, the people were to be
employed in holy actions, going to sermons and the like,
and to continue thus until Monday morning, a penalty
being laid on those who did the contrary. About the
year 1214, which was eleven years after, it was again enacted,
in a parliament at Scone, by Alexander III., king
of the Scots, that none should fish in any waters, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
Saturday after evening prayer, till sunrising on Monday,
which was afterward confirmed by King James I.”<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The sacredness of this papal Lord’s day seems
to have been more easily established by taking
in with it a part of the ancient Sabbath. The
work of establishing this institution was everywhere
carried steadily forward. Of England we
read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the year 1237, Henry III. being king, and Edmund
de Abendon archbishop of Canterbury, a constitution
was made, requiring every minister to forbid his parishioners
the frequenting of markets on the Lord’s day, and
leaving the church, where they ought to meet and spend
the day in prayer and hearing the word of God. And
this on pain of excommunication.”<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of France we are informed:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The council of Lyons sat about the year 1244, and it
restrained the people from their ordinary work on the
Lord’s day, and other festivals on pain of ecclesiastical
censures.”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1282. The council of Angeirs in France “forbid
millers by water or otherwise to grind their corn from
Saturday evening till Sunday evening.”<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor were the Spaniards backward in this
work:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1322. This year “a synod was called at Valladolid
in Castile, and then was ratified what was formerly
required, that ‘none should follow husbandry, or exercise
himself in any mechanical employment on the Lord’s
day, or other holy days, but where it was a work of necessity
or charity, of which the minister of the parish
was to be judge.’”<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The rulers of the church and realm of England
were diligent in establishing the sacredness of
this day. Yet the following statutes show that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
they were not aware of any Bible authority for
enforcing its observance:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1358. “Istippe, archbishop of Canterbury, with
very great concern and zeal, expresses himself thus: ‘We
have it from the relation of very credible persons, that in
divers places within our province, a very naughty, nay,
damnable custom has prevailed, to hold fairs and markets
on the Lord’s day.... Wherefore by virtue of canonical
obedience, we strictly charge and command your
brotherhood, that if you find your people faulty in the
premises, you forthwith admonish or cause them to be
admonished to refrain going to markets or fairs on the
Lord’s day.... And as for such who are obstinate
and speak or act against you in this particular, you must
endeavor to restrain them by ecclesiastical censures and
by all lawful means put a stop to these extravagances.’</p>

<p>“Nor was the civil power silent; for much about that
time King Edward made an act that wool should not be
shown at the staple on Sundays and other solemn feasts
in the year. In the reign of King Henry VI., Dr. Stafford
being archbishop of Canterbury, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1444, it was
decreed that fairs and markets should no more be kept
in churches and church-yards on the Lord’s day, or other
festivals, except in time of harvest.”<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Observe that fairs and markets were held in
the churches in England on Sundays as late as
1444! And even later than this such fairs were
allowed in harvest time. On the European continent
the sacredness of Sunday was persistently
urged. The council of Bourges urges its observance
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1532. “The Lord’s day and other festivals
were instituted for this purpose, that faithful Christians
abstaining from external work, might more freely, and
with greater piety devote themselves to God’s worship.”<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

</div>

<p>They did not seem to be aware of the fact
however that when the fear of God is taught by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
the precepts of men such worship is vain.<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> The
council of Rheims, which sat the next year, made
this decree:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1533. “Let the people assemble at their parish
churches on the Lord’s day, and other holidays, and be
present at mass, sermons and vespers. Let no man on
these days give himself to plays or dances, especially
during service.” And the historian adds: “In the same
year another synod at Tours, ordered the Lord’s day and
other holidays to be reverently observed under pain of
excommunication.”<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A council which assembled the following year
thus frankly confessed the divine origin of the
Sabbath, and the human origin of that festival
which has supplanted it:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1584. “Let all Christians remember that the
seventh day was consecrated by God, and hath been received
and observed, not only by the Jews, but by all others
who pretend to worship God; though we Christians have
changed their Sabbath into the Lord’s day. A day therefore
to be kept, by forbearing all worldly business, suits,
contracts, carriages, &amp;c., and by sanctifying the rest of
mind and body, in the contemplation of God and things
divine, we are to do nothing but works of charity, say
prayers, and sing psalms.”<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We have thus traced Sunday observance in the
Catholic church down to a period subsequent to
the Reformation. That it is an ordinance of man
which has usurped the place of the Bible Sabbath
is most distinctly confessed by the council last
quoted. Yet they endeavor to make amends for
their violation of the Sabbath by spending Sunday
in charity, prayers, and psalms: a course too
often adopted at the present time to excuse the
violation of the fourth commandment. Who can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
read this long list of Sunday laws, not from the
“one Law-giver who is able to save and to destroy,”
but from popes, emperors, and councils,
without adopting the sentiment of Neander:
“The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals,
was always only a human ordinance?”</p>

</div>

<p>With the accession of the Roman bishop to supremacy
began the Dark Ages;<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> and as he increased
in strength, the gloom of darkness settled with
increasing intensity upon the world. The highest
elevation of the papal power marks the latest
point in the Dark Ages before the first gray dawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
of twilight.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> That power was providentially
weakened preparatory to the reformation of the
sixteenth century, when the light of advancing
day began to manifestly dissipate the gross darkness
which covered the earth. The difficulty of
tracing the true people of God through this period
is well set forth in the following language
of Benedict:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As scarcely any fragment of their history remains,
all we know of them is from accounts of their enemies,
which were always uttered in the style of censure and
complaint; and without which we should not have
known that millions of them ever existed. It was the
settled policy of Rome to obliterate every vestige of opposition
to her doctrines and decrees; everything heretical,
whether persons or writings, by which the faithful
would be liable to be contaminated and led astray. In
conformity to this their fixed determination, all books
and records of their opposers were hunted up and committed
to the flames. Before the art of printing was discovered
in the fifteenth century, all books were made
with the pen; the copies, of course, were so few that
their concealment was much more difficult than it would
be now; and if a few of them escaped the vigilance of
the inquisitors, they would soon be worn out and gone.
None of them could be admitted and preserved in the
public libraries of the Catholics, from the ravages of time
and of the hands of barbarians with which all parts of
Europe were at different periods overwhelmed.”<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The first five centuries of the Christian era accomplished
the suppression of the Sabbath in
those churches which were under the special control
of the Roman pontiff. Thenceforward we
must look for the observers of the Sabbath outside
the communion of the church of Rome. It
was predicted that the Roman power should cast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
down the truth to the ground.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> The Scriptures
set forth the law of God as his truth.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> The Dark
Ages were the result of this work of the great
apostasy. So dense and all-pervading was the
darkness, that God’s pure truth was more or less
obscured even with the true people of God in
their places of retirement.</p>

<p>About the year 600, as we have seen, there
was in the city of Rome itself a class of Sabbath-keeping
Christians who were very strict in the
observance of the fourth commandment. It has
been said of them that they joined with this
a strict abstinence from labor on Sunday. But
Dr. Twisse, a learned first-day writer who has
particularly examined the record respecting them,
asserts that this Sunday observance pertained to
“other persons, different from the former.”<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> These
Sabbath-keepers were not Romanists, and the
pope denounced them in strong language.</p>

<p>The Christians of Great Britain, before the
mission of Augustine to that country, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 596,
were not in subjection to the bishop of Rome.
They were in an eminent degree Bible Christians.
They are thus described:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Scottish church, when it first meets the eye of
civilization, is not Romish, nor even prelatical. When
the monk Augustine, with his forty missionaries, in the
time of the Saxon Heptarchy, came over to Britain under
the auspices of Gregory, the bishop of Rome, to convert
the barbarian Saxons, he found the northern part of the
island already well-nigh filled with Christians and Christian
institutions. These Christians were the Culdees,
whose chief seat was the little island of Hi or Iona, on
the western coast of Scotland. An Irish presbyter, Columba,
feeling himself stirred with missionary zeal, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
doubtless knowing the wretched condition of the savage
Scots and Picts, in the year 565, took with him twelve
other missionaries, and passed over to Scotland. They
fixed their settlement on the little island just named, and
from that point became the missionaries of all Scotland,
and even penetrated into England.<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>“The people in the south of England converted by
Augustine and his assistants, and those in the north who
had been won by Culdee labor, soon met, as Christian
conquest advanced from both sides; and when they came
together, it was soon seen that Roman and Culdee Christianity
very decidedly differed in a great many respects.
The Culdees, for the most part, had a simple and primitive
form of Christianity, while Rome presented a vast
accumulation of superstitions, and was arrayed in her
well-known pomp.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>“The Culdee went to Iona that in quiet, with meditation,
study, and prayer, he might fit himself for going
out into the world as a missionary. Indeed, Iona was a
great mission institute, where preachers were trained who
evangelized the rude tribes of Scotland in a very short
time. To have done such a work as this in less than
half a century implies apostolic activity, purity, and success.<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<p>“After the success of Agustine and his monks in England,
the Culdees had shut themselves up within the
limits of Scotland, and had resisted for centuries all the efforts
of Rome to win them over. At last, however, they
were overthrown by their own rulers.”<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is strong incidental evidence that Columba,
the leading minister of his time among
the Culdees, was an observer of the ancient Sabbath
of the Bible. On this point I quote two
standard authors of the Roman Catholics. They
certainly have no motive to put such words as I
here quote, fraudulently into the mouth of Columba,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
for they claim him as a saint, and they are no
friends of the Bible Sabbath. Nor can we see
how Columba could have used these words with
satisfaction, as he evidently did, when dying,
had he all his life long been a violator of the ancient
rest-day of the Lord. Here are the words
of Dr. Alvan Butler:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having continued his labors in Scotland thirty-four
years, he clearly and openly foretold his death, and on
Saturday the ninth of June said to his disciple Diermit:
‘This day is called the Sabbath, that is, the day of rest,
and such will it truly be to me; for it will put an end to
my labors.’”<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another distinguished Catholic author gives
us his dying words thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To-day is Saturday, the day which the Holy Scriptures
call the Sabbath, or rest. And it will be truly my
day of rest, for it shall be the last of my laborious life.”<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These words show, 1. That Columba believed
that Saturday was the true Bible Sabbath. 2.
That he did not believe the Sabbath had been
changed to Sunday. 3. That this confession of
faith respecting the Bible Sabbath was made
with evident satisfaction, though in view of immediate
death. Did any first-day man ever recur
with pleasure on his death-bed to the fact
that Saturday is the Bible Sabbath?</p>

<p>But Gilfillan quotes these words of Columba
as spoken in behalf of Sunday! In giving a list
of eminent men who have asserted the change of
the Sabbath, or who have called Sunday the Sabbath,
and have taught that it should be observed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
as a day of sacred rest, he brings in Columba
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The testimony of Columba is specially interesting,
as it expresses the feelings of the heart at a moment
which tests the sincerity of faith, and the value of a creed:
‘This day,’ he said to his servant, ‘in the sacred volume
is called the Sabbath, that is, rest; and will indeed be a
Sabbath to me, for it is to me the last day of this toilsome
life, the day on which I am to rest (sabbatize), after
all my labors and troubles, for on this coming sacred
night of the Lord (<i>Dominica nocte</i>), at the midnight hour,
I shall, as the Scriptures speak, go the way of my fathers.’”<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>But this day which Columba said “will indeed
be a Sabbath to me” was not Sunday but Saturday.</p>

<p>Among the dissenters from the Romish church
in the period of the Dark Ages, the first place
perhaps is due to the Waldenses, both for their
antiquity and the wide extent of their influence
and doctrine. Benedict quotes from their enemies
respecting the antiquity of their origin:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have already observed from Claudius Seyssel, the
popish archbishop, that one Leo was charged with originating
the Waldensian heresy in the valleys, in the days
of Constantine the Great. When those severe measures
emanated from the Emperor Honorious against rebaptizers,
the Baptists left the seat of opulence and power,
and sought retreats in the country, and in the valleys of
Piedmont; which last place in particular became their
retreat from imperial oppression.”<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dean Waddington quotes the following from
Rainer Saccho, a popish writer, who had the best
means of information respecting them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is no sect so dangerous as the Leonists, for
three reasons: first, it is the most ancient—some say as
old as Sylvester [pope in Constantine’s time], others as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
the apostles themselves. Secondly, it is very generally
disseminated: there is no country where it has not gained
some footing. Thirdly, while other sects are profane and
blasphemous, this retains the utmost show of piety; they
live justly before men, and believe nothing respecting
God which is not good.”<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Jones gives Saccho’s own opinion as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Their enemies confirm their great antiquity. Reinerius
Saccho, an inquisitor, and one of their most cruel
persecutors, who lived only eighty years after Waldo [<span class="allsmcap">A.
D.</span> 1160], admits that the Waldenses flourished five hundred
years before that preacher. Gretser, the Jesuit,
who also wrote against the Waldenses, and had examined
the subject fully, not only admits their great antiquity,
but declares his firm belief that the Toulousians and Albigenses
condemned in the years 1177 and 1178, were no
other than the Waldenses.”<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Jortin dates their withdrawal into the wilderness
of the Alps as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 601. In the seventh century, Christianity was
propagated in China by the Nestorians; and the Valdenses,
who abhorred the papal usurptions, are supposed to
have settled themselves in the valleys of Piedmont.
Monkery flourished prodigiously, and the monks and
popes were in the firmest union.”<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

</div>

<p>President Edwards says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some of the popish writers themselves own, that this
people never submitted to the church of Rome. One of
the popish writers, speaking of the Waldenses, says, The
heresy of the Waldenses is the oldest heresy in the world.
It is supposed that they first betook themselves to this
place among the mountains, to hide themselves from the
severity of the heathen persecutions which existed before
Constantine the Great. And thus the woman fled into
the wilderness from the face of the serpent. Rev. 12:6,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
14. ‘And to the woman were given two wings of a great
eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her
place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and
half a time, from the face of the serpent.’ The people
being settled there, their posterity continued [there] from
age to age; and being, as it were, by natural walls, as
well as by God’s grace, separated from the rest of the
world, they never partook of the overflowing corruption.”<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Benedict makes other quotations relative to
their origin:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Theodore Belvedre, a popish monk, says that the
heresy had always been in the valleys. In the preface to
the French Bible the translators say that they [the Waldenses]
have always had the full enjoyment of the heavenly
truth contained in the Holy Scriptures ever since
they were enriched with the same by the apostles; having
in fair MSS. preserved the entire Bible in their native
tongue from generation to generation.”<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of the extent to which they spread in the
countries of Europe, Benedict thus speaks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the thirteenth century, from the accounts of Catholic
historians, all of whom speak of the Waldenses in
terms of complaint and reproach, they had founded individual
churches, or were spread out in colonies in Italy,
Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Bohemia, Poland,
Lithuania, Albania, Lombardy, Milan, Romagna, Vicenza,
Florence, Veleponetine, Constantinople, Philadelphia,
Sclavonia, Bulgaria, Diognitia, Livonia, Sarmatia,
Croatia, Dalmatia, Briton and Piedmont.”<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Dr. Edgar gives the words of an old historian
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Waldensians, says Popliner, spread, not only
through France, but also through nearly all the European
coasts, and appeared in Gaul, Spain, England, Scotland,
Italy, Germany, Bohemia, Saxony, Poland, and Lithuania.”<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span></p>

<p>According to the testimony of their enemies,
they were to some extent divided among themselves.
Dr. Allix quotes an old Romish writer
who says of that portion of them who were called
Cathari:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They are also divided amongst themselves; so what
some of them say is again denied by others.”<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Crosby makes a similar statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There were several sects of Waldenses or Albigenses,
like as there are of Dissenters in England. Some of
these did deny all baptism, others only the baptism of
infants. That many of them were of this latter opinion,
is affirmed in several histories of this people, as well ancient
as modern.”<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Some of their enemies affirm that they reject
the Old Testament; but others, with much greater
truthfulness, bear a very different testimony.<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>
Thus a Romish inquisitor, as quoted by Allix,
bears testimony concerning those in Bohemia:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They can say a great part of the Old and New Testaments
by heart. They despise the decretals, and the sayings
and expositions of holy men, and only cleave to the
text of Scripture.... [They say] that the doctrine
of Christ and the apostles is sufficient to salvation, without
any church statutes and ordinances. That the traditions
of the church are no better than the traditions
of the Pharisees; and that greater stress is laid on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
the observation of human traditions than on the keeping
of the law of God. Why do you transgress the law of
God by your traditions?... They contemn all approved
ecclesiastical customs which they do not read of in
the gospel, as the observation of Candlemas, Palm Sunday,
the reconciliation of penitents, the adoration of the
cross on Good Friday. They despise the feast of Easter,
and all other festivals of Christ and the saints, because
of their being multiplied to that vast number, and say
that one day is as good as another, and work upon holy
days, where they can do it without being taken notice
of.”<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Allix quotes a Waldensian document of
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1100, entitled the “Noble Lesson,” and remarks:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The author upon supposal that the world was drawing
to an end, exhorts his brethren to prayer, to watchfulness,
to a renouncing of all worldly goods....</p>

<p>“He sets down all the judgments of God in the Old
Testament as the effects of a just and good God; and in
particular the decalogue as a law given by the Lord of
the whole world. He repeats the several articles of the
law, not forgetting that which respects idols.”<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Their religious views are further stated by
Allix:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They declare themselves to be the apostles’ successors,
to have apostolical authority, and the keys of binding
and loosing. They hold the church of Rome to be the
whore of Babylon, and that all that obey her are damned,
especially the clergy that are subject to her since the time
of Pope Sylvester.... They hold that none of the
ordinances of the church that have been introduced since
Christ’s ascension ought to be observed, as being of no
worth; the feasts, fasts, orders, blessings, offices of the
church and the like, they utterly reject.”<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A considerable part of the people called Waldenses
bore the significant designation of <i>Sabbati</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
or <i>Sabbatati</i>, or <i>Insabbatati</i>. Mr. Jones
alludes to this fact in the following words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Because they would not observe saints’ days, they
were falsely supposed to neglect the Sabbath also, and
called <i>Insabbatati</i> or <i>Insabbathists</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Benedict makes the following statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We find that the Waldenses were sometimes called <i>Insabbathos</i>,
that is, regardless of Sabbaths. Mr. Milner supposes
this name was given to them because they observed
not the Romish festivals, and rested from their ordinary
occupations only on Sundays. A Sabbatarian would
suppose that it was because they met for worship on the
seventh day, and did regard not the first-day Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Robinson gives the statements of three
classes of writers respecting the meaning of these
names, which were borne by the Waldenses. But
he rejects them all, alleging that these persons
were led to these conclusions by the apparent
meaning of the words, and not by the facts.
Here are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some of these Christians were called <i>Sabbati</i>, <i>Sabbatati</i>,
<i>Insabbatati</i>, and more frequently <i>Inzabbatati</i>. Led
astray by sound without attending to facts, one says they
were so named from the Hebrew word Sabbath, because
they kept the Saturday for the Lord’s day. Another
says they were so called because they rejected all the festivals
or Sabbaths in the low Latin sense of the word,
which the Catholic church religiously observed. A third
says, and many with various alterations and additions
have said after him, they were called so from <i>sabot</i> or <i>zabot</i>,
a shoe, because they distinguished themselves from
other people by wearing shoes marked on the upper part
with some peculiarity. Is it likely that people who could
not descend from their mountains without hazarding their
lives through the furious zeal of the inquisitors, should
tempt danger by affixing a visible mark on their shoes?
Besides the shoe of the peasants happens to be famous in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
this country; it was of a different fashion, and was called
abarca.”<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Robinson rejects these three statements,
and then gives his own judgment that they were
so called because they lived in the mountains.
These four views cover all that has been advanced
relative to the meaning of these names.
But Robinson’s own explanation is purely fanciful,
and seems to have been adopted by no other
writer. He offers, however, conclusive reasons
for rejecting the statement that they took their
name from their shoes. There remain, therefore,
only the first and second of these four statements,
which are that they were called by these
names because they kept the Saturday for the
Lord’s day, and because they did not keep the
sabbaths of the papists. These two statements
do not conflict. In fact, if one of them be true,
it almost certainly follows that the other one
must be true also. There would be in such facts
something worthy to give a distinguishing name
to the true people of God, surrounded by the
great apostasy; and the natural and obvious interpretation
of the names would disclose the
most striking characteristic of the people who
bore them.</p>

<p>Jones and Benedict agree with Robinson in
rejecting the idea that the Waldenses received
these names from their shoes. Mr. Jones held, on
the contrary, that they were given them because
they did not keep the Romish festivals.<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> Mr.
Benedict favors the view that it was because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
they kept the seventh day.<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> But let us now see
who they are that make these statements respecting
the observance of the Sabbath by the Waldenses,
that Robinson alludes to in this place.
He quotes out of Gretser the words of the historian
Goldastus as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Insabbatati [they were called] not because they were
circumcised, but because they kept the Jewish Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Goldastus was “a learned historian and jurist,
born near Bischofszell in Switzerland in 1576.”
He died in 1635.<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> He was a Calvinist writer of
note.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> He certainly had no motive to favor the
cause of the seventh day. Gretser objects to his
statement on the ground that the Waldenses exterminated
every festival; but this was the most
natural thing in the world for men who had God’s
own rest-day in their keeping. Gretser still further
objects that the Waldenses denied the whole
Old Testament; but this charge is an utter misrepresentation,
as we have already shown in the
present chapter.</p>

<p>Robinson also quotes on this point the testimony
of Archbishop Usher. Though that prelate
held that the Waldenses derived these
names from their shoes, he frankly acknowledges
that <span class="smcap">many</span> understood that they were given to
them because they worshiped on the Jewish
Sabbath. This testimony is valuable in that it
shows that many early writers asserted the observance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
of “the Saturday for the Lord’s day”
by the people who were called Sabbatati.<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of the persecutions which
they suffered, and because also of their own missionary
zeal, the people called Waldenses were
widely scattered over Europe. They bore, however,
various names in different ages and in different
countries. We have decisive testimony
that some of these bodies observed the seventh
day. Others observed Sunday. Eneas Sylvius
says that those in Bohemia hold “that we are to
cease from working on no day except the Lord’s
day.”<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> This statement, let it be observed, relates
only to Bohemia. But it has been asserted that
the Waldenses were so distinct from the church
of Rome they could not have received the Sunday
Lord’s day from thence, and must, therefore,
have received it from the apostles! But a few
words from D’Aubigné will suffice to show that
this statement is founded in error. He describes
an interview between Œcolampadius and two
Waldensian pastors who had been sent by their
brethren from the borders of France and Piedmont,
to open communication with the reformers.
It was at Basle, in 1530. Many things
which they said pleased Œcolampadius, but some
things he disapproved. D’Aubigné makes this
statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The barbes [the Waldensian pastors] were at first a
little confused at seeing that the elders had to learn of
their juniors; however, they were humble and sincere
men, and the Basle doctor having questioned them on
the sacraments, they confessed that through weakness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
and fear <i>they had their children baptized by Romish priests</i>,
and that <i>they even communicated with them and sometimes
attended mass</i>. This unexpected avowal startled the meek
Œcolampadius.”<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

</div>

<p>When the deputation returned word to the
Waldenses that the reformers demanded of them
“a stricter reform,” D’Aubigné says that it was
“supported by some, and rejected by others.” He
also informs us that the demand that the Waldenses
should “separate entirely from Rome”
“caused divisions among them.”<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></p>

<p>This is a very remarkable statement. The
light of many of these ancient witnesses was almost
ready to go out in darkness when God
raised up the reformers. They had suffered that
woman Jezebel to teach among them, and to seduce
the servants of God. They had even come
to practice infant baptism, and the priests of
Rome administered the rite! And in addition
to all this, they sometimes joined with them in
the service of the mass! If a portion of the
Waldenses in southern Europe at the time of
the Reformation had exchanged believers’ baptism
for the baptism of children by Romish
priests, it is not difficult to see how they could
also accept the Sunday-Lord’s day from the same
source in place of the hallowed rest-day of the
Lord. All had not done this, but some certainly
had.</p>

<p>D’Aubigné makes a very interesting statement
respecting the French Waldenses in the fifteenth
century. His language implies that they had a
different Sabbath from the Catholics. He tells
us some of the stories which the priests circulated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
against the Waldenses. These are his
words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Picardy in the north and Dauphiny in the south were
the two provinces of France best prepared [at the opening
of the Protestant Reformation] to receive the gospel.
During the fifteenth century many Picardins, as the story
ran, went to <i>Vaudery</i>. Seated round the fire during the
long nights, simple Catholics used to tell one another
how the <i>Vaudois</i> (Waldenses) met in horrible assembly in
solitary places, where they found tables spread with numerous
and dainty viands. These poor Christians loved
indeed to meet together from districts often very remote.
They went to the rendezvous by night and along by-roads.
The most learned of them used to recite some passages of
Scripture, after which they conversed together and prayed.
But such humble conventicles were ridiculously travestied.
‘Do you know what they do to get there,’ said the people,
‘so that the officers may not stop them? The devil
has given them a certain ointment, and when they want
to go to <i>Vaudery</i>, they smear a little stick with it. As
soon as they get astride it, they are carried up through
the air, and arrive at <i>their Sabbath</i> without meeting anybody.
In the midst of them sits a goat with a monkey’s
tail: this is Satan, who receives their adoration.’...
These stupid stories were not peculiar to the people: they
were circulated particularly by the monks. It was thus
that the inquisitor Jean de Broussart spoke in 1460 from
a pulpit erected in the great square at Arras. An immense
multitude surrounded him; a scaffold was erected
in front of the pulpit, and a number of men and women,
kneeling and wearing caps with the figure of the devil
painted on them, awaited their punishment. Perhaps
the faith of these poor people was mingled with error.
But be that as it may, they were all burnt alive after the
sermon.”<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It seems that these Waldenses had a Sabbath
peculiar to themselves. And D’Aubigné himself
alludes to something peculiar in their faith which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
he cannot confess as the truth, and does not
choose to denounce as error. He says, “Perhaps
the faith of these poor people was mingled with
error.” To speak of the observance of the seventh
day as the Sabbath of the Lord by New-Testament
Christians, subjects a conscientious
first-day historian to this very dilemma. We
have a further account of the Waldenses in
France, just before the commencement of the
Reformation of the sixteenth century:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Louis XII., king of France, being informed by the
enemies of the Waldenses inhabiting a part of the province
of Provence, that several heinous crimes were laid to
their account, sent the Master of Requests, and a certain
doctor of the Sorbonne, who was confessor to His Majesty,
to make inquiry into this matter. On their return,
they reported that they had visited all the parishes where
they dwelt, had inspected their places of worship, but
that they had found there no images, nor signs of the
ornaments belonging to the mass, nor any of the ceremonies
of the Romish church; much less could they discover
any traces of those crimes with which they were
charged. On the contrary, they kept the Sabbath day,
observed the ordinance of baptism according to the primitive
church, instructed their children in the articles of
the Christian faith and the commandments of God. The
king having heard the report of his commissioners, said
with an oath that they were better men than himself or
his people.”<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We further read concerning the Vaudois, or
Waldenses, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The respectable French historian, De Thou, says that
the Vaudois keep the commandments of the decalogue,
and allow among them of no wickedness, detesting perjuries,
imprecations, quarrels, seditions, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It maybe proper to add that in 1686 the Waldenses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
were all driven out of the valleys of Piedmont,
and that those who returned and settled in
those valleys three years afterward, and from
whom the present race of Waldenses is descended,
fought their way back, sword in hand, pursuing
in all respects a course entirely different from that
of the ancient Waldenses.<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>Another class of witnesses to the truth during
the Dark Ages, bore the name of Cathari, that is,
Puritans. Jones speaks of them as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They were a plain, unassuming, harmless, and industrious
race of Christians, patiently bearing the cross after
Christ, and, both in their doctrines and manners, condemning
the whole system of idolatry and superstition
which reigned in the church of Rome, placing true religion
in the faith, hope and obedience of the gospel, maintaining
a supreme regard to the authority of God in his
word, and regulating their sentiments and practices by
that divine standard. Even in the twelfth century their
numbers abounded in the neighborhood of Cologne, in
Flanders, the South of France, Savoy, and Milan.
‘They were increased,’ says Egbert, ‘to great multitudes,
throughout all countries.’”<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That the Cathari did retain and observe the
ancient Sabbath, is certified by their Romish adversaries.
Dr. Allix quotes a Roman Catholic author
of the twelfth century concerning three sorts
of heretics, the Cathari, the Passagii, and the Arnoldistæ.
Allix says of this Romish writer that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He lays it down also as one of their opinions, ‘that
the law of Moses is to be kept according to the letter, and
that the keeping of the Sabbath, circumcision, and other
legal observances, ought to take place. They hold also
that Christ the Son of God is not equal with the Father,
and that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, these three
persons, are not one God and one substance; and as a surplus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
to these their errors, they judge and condemn all the
doctors of the church, and universally the whole Roman
church. Now since they endeavor to defend this their
error by testimonies drawn from the New Testament and
prophets, I shall with [the] assistance of the grace of
Christ stop their mouths, as David did Goliah’s, with
their own sword.’”<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Allix quotes another Romish author to the
same effect:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Alanus attributes to the Cathari almost the very same
opinions [as those just enumerated] in his first book
against heretics, which he wrote about the year 1192.”<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Elliott mentions an incident concerning the
Cathari, which is in harmony with what these
historians assert respecting their observance of
the seventh day. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this year [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1163] certain heretics of the sect
of the Cathari, coming from the parts of Flanders to
Cologne, took up their abode secretly in a barn near the
city. But, as <i>on the Lord’s day</i> they did not go to church,
they were seized by the neighbors, and detected. On
their being brought before the Catholic church, when,
after long examination respecting their sect, they would
be convinced by no evidence however convincing, but
most pertinaciously persisted in their doctrine and resolution,
they were cast out from the church, and delivered
into the hands of laics. These, leading them without the
city committed them to the flames: being four men and
one little girl.”<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These statements are made respecting three
classes of Christian people who lived during the
Dark Ages: The Cathari, or Puritans, the Arnoldistæ,
and the Passaginians. Their views are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
presented in the uncandid language of their enemies.
But the testimony of ancient Catholic
historians is decisive that they were observers of
the seventh day. The charge that they observed
circumcision also, will be noticed presently. Mr.
Robinson understands that the Passaginians were
that portion of the Waldenses who lived in the
passes of the mountains. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is very credible that the name Passageros or
Passagini ... was given to such of them as lived in or
near the passes or passages of the mountains, and who
subsisted in part by guiding travelers or by traveling
themselves for trade.”<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Elliott says of the <i>name</i> Passagini:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The explanation of the term as meaning <i>Pilgrims</i>, in
both the spiritual and missionary sense of the word,
would be but the translation of their recognized Greek
appellation εκδημοι, and a title as distinctive as beautiful.”<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mosheim gives the following account of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In Lombardy, which was the principal residence of
the Italian heretics, there sprung up a singular sect,
known, for what reason I cannot tell, by the denomination
of Passaginians, and also by that of the circumcised.
Like the other sects already mentioned, they had the utmost
aversion to the dominion and discipline of the church
of Rome; but they were at the same time distinguished
by two religious tenets which were peculiar to themselves.
The first was a notion that the observance of the law of
Moses, in everything except the offering of sacrifices, was
obligatory upon Christians; in consequence of which they
circumcised their followers, abstained from those meats
the use of which was prohibited under the Mosaic economy,
and celebrated the Jewish Sabbath. The second
tenet that distinguished this sect was advanced in opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
to the doctrine of three persons in the divine nature.”<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Benedict speaks of them as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The account of their practicing circumcision is undoubtedly
a slanderous story forged by their enemies,
and probably arose in this way: because they observed
the seventh day they were called by way of derision,
Jews, as the Sabbatarians are frequently at this day; and
if they were Jews, it followed of course that they either
did, or ought to, circumcise their followers. This was
probably the reasoning of their enemies; but that they
actually practiced the bloody rite is altogether improbable.”<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></p>

</div>

<p>An eminent church historian, Michael Geddes,
thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This [act] of fixing something that is justly abominable
to all mankind upon her adversaries, has been the
constant practice of the church of Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Allix states the same fact, which needs to
be kept in mind whenever we read of the people
of God in the records of the Dark Ages:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I must desire the reader to consider that it is no
great sin with the church of Rome to spread lies concerning
those that are enemies of that faith.”<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is nothing more common with the Romish
party than to make use of the most horrid calumnies to
blacken and expose those who have renounced her communion.”<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of the origin of the Petrobrusians, we have the
following account by Mr. Jones:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the Cathari or Puritans were not the only sect
which, during the twelfth century, appeared in opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
to the superstition of the church of Rome. About the
year 1110, in the south of France, in the provinces of
Languedoc and Provence, appeared Peter de Bruys,
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of Heaven, and exerting
the most laudable efforts to reform the abuses and
remove the superstition which disfigured the beautiful
simplicity of the gospel worship. His labors were crowned
with abundant success. He converted a great number of
disciples to the faith of Christ, and after a most indefatigable
ministry of twenty years’ continuance, he
was burned at St. Giles, a city of Languedoc in France,
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1130, by an enraged populace, instigated by the
clergy, who apprehended their traffic to be in danger from
this new and intrepid reformer.”<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That this body of French Christians, who, in
the very midnight of the Dark Ages witnessed
for the truth in opposition to the Romish church,
were observers of the ancient Sabbath is expressly
certified by Dr. Francis White, lord bishop
of Ely. He was appointed by the king of England
to write against the Sabbath in opposition
to Brabourne, who had appealed to the king in
its behalf. To show that Sabbatic observance
is contrary to the doctrine of the Catholic church—a
weighty argument with an Episcopalian—he
enumerates various classes of heretics who had
been condemned by the Catholic church for keeping
holy the seventh day. Among these heretics
he places the Petrobrusians:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In St. Bernard’s days it was condemned in the Petrobruysans.”<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We have seen that, according to Catholic writers,
the Cathari held to the observance of the
seventh day. Dr. Allix confirms the statement
of Dr. White that the Petrobrusians observed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
ancient Sabbath, by stating that the doctrines of
these two bodies greatly resembled each other.
These are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Petrus Cluniacensis has handled five questions against
the Petrobrusians which bear a great resemblance with the
belief of the Cathari of Italy.”<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Sabbath-keepers in the eleventh century
were of sufficient importance to call down upon
themselves the anathema of the pope. Dr. Heylyn
says that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Gregory, of that name the seventh [about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1074],
condemned those who taught that it was not lawful to do
work on the day of the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This act of the pope corroborates the testimonies
we have adduced in proof of the existence of
Sabbath-keepers in the Dark Ages. Gregory the
Seventh was one of the greatest men that ever
filled the papal chair. Whatever class he anathematized
was of some consequence. Gregory
wasted nothing on trifles.<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<p>In the eleventh century, there were Sabbath-keepers
also in Constantinople and its vicinity.
The pope, in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1054, sent three legates to the
emperor of the East, and to the patriarch of Constantinople,
for the purpose of re-uniting the
Greek and the Latin churches. Cardinal Humbert
was the head of this legation. The legates,
on their arrival, set themselves to the work of
refuting those doctrines which distinguish the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
church of Constantinople from that of Rome.
After they had attended to the questions which
separated the two churches, they found it also
necessary to discuss the question of the Sabbath.
For one of the most learned men of the East had
put forth a treatise, in which he maintained that
ministers should be allowed to marry; that the
Sabbath should be kept holy; and that leavened
bread should be used in the supper; all of which
the church of Rome held to be deadly heresies.
We quote from Mr. Bower a concise statement of
the treatment which this Sabbatarian writer received:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Humbert, likewise answered a piece that had been
published by a monk of the monastery of Studium, [near
Constantinople,] named Nicetas, who was deemed <i>one of
the most learned men at the time in the east</i>. In that piece
the monk undertook to prove, that leavened bread only
should be used in the eucharist, <i>that the Sabbath ought to
be kept holy</i>, and that priests should be allowed to marry.
But the emperor, who wanted by all means to gain the
pope, for the reasons mentioned above, was, or rather
pretended to be, so fully convinced with the arguments
of the legate, confuting those alleged by Nicetas, that he
obliged the monk publickly to recant, and anathematize
<i>all who held the opinion</i> that he had endeavored to establish,
with respect to unleavened bread, the Sabbath, and
the marriage of priests.</p>

<p>“At the same time Nicetas, in compliance with the
command of the emperor, anathematized all who should
question the primacy of the Roman church with respect
to all other Christian churches, or should presume to
censure her ever orthodox faith. The monk having thus
retracted all he had written against the Holy See, his
book was burnt by the emperor’s order, and he absolved,
by the legates, from the censures he had incurred.”<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This record shows that, in the dense darkness
of the eleventh century, “one of the most learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
men at that time in the east” wrote a book to
prove that “the Sabbath ought to be kept holy,”
and in opposition to the papal doctrine of the
celibacy of the clergy. It also shows how the
church of Rome caste down the truth of God by
means of the sword of emperors and kings.
Though Nicetas retracted, under fear of the emperor
and the pope, it appears that there were
others who held the same opinions, for he was
“obliged” to anathematize all such, and there is
no evidence that any of these persons turned
from the truth because of the fall of their leader.
Indeed, if there had not been a considerable body
of these Sabbatarians, the papal legate would
never have deemed it worthy of his dignity to
write a reply to Nicetas.</p>

<p>The Anabaptists are often referred to in the
records of the Dark Ages. The term signifies rebaptizers,
and was applied to them because they
denied the validity of infant baptism. The designation
is not accurate, however, because those
persons whom they baptized, they considered as
never having been baptized before, although they
had been sprinkled or even immersed in infancy.
This people have been overwhelmed in obloquy
in consequence of the fanatical insurrection which
broke out in their name in the time of Luther.
Of those engaged in this insurrection, Buck
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first insurgents groaned under severe oppressions,
and took up arms in defense of their civil liberties;
and of these commotions the Anabaptists seem rather to
have availed themselves, than to have been the prime
movers. That a great part were Anabaptists seems indisputable;
at the same time it appears from history that a
great part also were Roman Catholics, and a still greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
part of those who had scarcely any religious principles
at all.”<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This matter is placed in the true light by
Stebbing:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The overthrow of civil society, and fatal injuries to
religion were threatened by those who called themselves
Anabaptists. But large numbers appear to have disputed
the validity of infant baptism who had nothing else in
common with them, yet who for that one circumstance
were overwhelmed with the obloquy, and the punishment
richly due to a fanaticism equally fraudulent and licentious.”<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The ancient Sabbath was retained and observed
by a portion of the Anabaptists, or, to use
a more proper term, Baptists. Dr. Francis White
thus testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They which maintain the Saturday Sabbath to be in
force, comply with some Anabaptists.”<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In harmony with this statement of Dr. White,
is the testimony of a French writer of the sixteenth
century. He names all the classes of men
who have borne the name of Anabaptists. Of
one of these classes he writes thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some have endured great torments, because they
would not keep Sundays and festival days, in despite of
Antichrist: seeing they were days appointed by Antichrist,
they would not hold forth any thing which is like
unto him. Others observe these days, but it is out of
charity.”<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus it is seen that within the limits of the
old Roman Empire, and in the midst of those
countries that submitted to the rule of the pope,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
God reserved unto himself a people that did not
bow the knee to Baal, and among these the Bible
Sabbath was observed from age to age. We are
now to search for the Sabbath among those who
were never subjected to the Roman pontiff. In
Central Africa, from the first part of the Christian
era—possibly from the time of the conversion
of the Ethiopian officer of great authority<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a>
but very certainly as early as <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 330<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a>—have
existed the churches of Abyssinia and Ethiopia.
About the time of the accession of the Roman
Bishop to supremacy, they were lost sight of by
the nations of Europe. “Encompassed on all
sides,” says Gibbon, “by the enemies of their religion,
the Ethiopians slept near a thousand years,
forgetful of the world, by whom they were forgotten.”<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>
In the latter part of the fifteenth
century, they were again brought to the knowledge
of the world by the discovery of Portuguese
navigators. Undoubtedly they have been greatly
affected by the dense darkness of pagan and Mahometan
errors with which they are encompassed;
and in many respects they have lost the pure and
spiritual religion of our divine Redeemer. A
modern traveler says of them: “They have divers
errors and many ancient truths.”<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> Michael
Geddes says of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Abyssinians do hold the Scriptures to be the
perfect rule of the Christian faith; insomuch that they
deny it to be in the power of a general council to oblige
people to believe anything as an article of faith without
an express warrant from thence.”<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span></p>

<p>They practice circumcision, but for other reasons
than that of a religious duty.<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> Geddes further
states their views:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Transubstantiation and the adoration of the consecrated
bread in the sacrament, were what the Abyssinians
abhorred.... They deny purgatory, and know
nothing of confirmation and extreme unction; they condemn
graven images; they keep both Saturday and Sunday.”<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Their views of the Sabbath are stated by the
ambassador of the king of Ethiopia, at the court
of Lisbon, in the following words, explaining
their abstinence from all labor on that day:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Because God, after he had finished the creation of
the world, rested thereon; which day, as God would have
it called the holy of holies, so the not celebrating thereof
with great honor and devotion, seems to be plainly contrary
to God’s will and precept, who will suffer heaven
and earth to pass away sooner than his word; and that
especially, since Christ came not to destroy the law, but
to fulfill it. It is not therefore in imitation of the Jews,
but in obedience to Christ and his holy apostles, that we
observe that day.”<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The ambassador states their reasons for first-day
observance in these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We do observe the Lord’s day after the manner of
all other Christians in memory of Christ’s resurrection.”<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He had no scripture to offer in support of this
festival, and evidently rested its observance upon
tradition. This account was given by the ambassador
in 1534. In the early part of the next
century the emperor of Abyssinia was induced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
to submit to the pope in these words: “I confess
that the pope is the vicar of Christ, the successor
of St. Peter, and the sovereign of the world. To
him I swear true obedience, and at his feet I offer
my person and kingdom.”<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> No sooner had
the Roman bishop thus brought the emperor to
submit to him than that potentate was compelled
to gratify the popish hatred of the Sabbath by
an edict forbidding its further observance. In
the words of Geddes, he “set forth a proclamation
prohibiting all his subjects upon severe penalties
to observe Saturday any longer.”<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> Or as
Gibbon expresses it, “The Abyssinians were enjoined
to work and to play on the Sabbath.”
But the tyranny of the Romanists, after a terrible
struggle, caused their overthrow and banishment,
and the restoration of the ancient faith.
The churches resounded with a song of triumph,
“‘that the sheep of Ethiopia were now delivered
from the hyænas of the West;’ and the gates of
that solitary realm were forever shut against the
arts, the science, and the fanaticism of Europe.”<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></p>

<p>We have proved in a former chapter that the
Sabbath was extensively observed as late as the
middle of the fifth century in the so-called Catholic
church, especially in that portion most intimately
connected with the Abyssinians; and
that from various causes, Sunday obtained certain
Sabbatic honors, in consequence of which
the two days were called sisters. We have also
shown in another chapter that the effectual suppression
of the Sabbath in Europe is mainly due
to papal influence. And so for a thousand years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
we have been tracing its history in the records
of those men which the church of Rome has
sought to kill.</p>

<p>These facts are strikingly corroborated by the
case of the Abyssinians. In consequence of their
location in the interior of Africa, the Abyssinians
ceased to be known to the rest of Christendom
about the fifth century. At this point, the Sabbath
and the Sunday in the Catholic church
were counted sisters. One thousand years later,
these African churches are visited, and though
surrounded by the thick darkness of pagan and
Mahometan superstition, and somewhat affected
thereby, they are found at the end of this period
holding the Sabbath and first-day substantially
as held by the Catholic church when they were
lost sight of by it. The Catholics of Europe on
the contrary had, in the meantime, trampled the
ancient Sabbath in the dust. Why was this
great contrast? Simply because the pope ruled
in Europe, while central Africa, whatever else it
may have suffered, was not cursed with his presence
nor with his influence. But so soon as the
pope learned of the existence of the Abyssinian
churches, he sought to gain control of them, and
when he had gained it, one of his first acts was
to suppress the Sabbath! In the end, the Abyssinians
regained their independence, and thenceforward
till the present time have held fast the
Sabbath of the Lord.</p>

<p>The Armenians of the East Indies are peculiarly
worthy of our attention. J. W. Massie, M.
R. I. A., says of the East Indian Christians:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Remote from the busy haunts of commerce, or the
populous seats of manufacturing industry, they may be
regarded as the eastern Piedmontese, the Vallois of Hindoostan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
the witnesses prophesying in sackcloth through
revolving centuries, though indeed their bodies lay as
dead in the streets of the city which they had once peopled.”<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Geddes says of those in Malabar:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The three great doctrines of popery, the pope’s supremacy,
transubstantiation, the adoration of images,
were never believed nor practiced at any time in this ancient
apostolical church.... I think one may venture
to say that before the time of the late Reformation, there
was no church that we know of, no, not that of the Vaudois,
... that had so few errors in doctrine as the church
of Malabar.” He adds concerning those churches that
“were never within the bounds of the Roman Empire,”
“It is in those churches that we are to meet with the
least of the leaven of popery.”<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Massie further describes these Christians:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The creed which these representatives of an ancient
line of Christians cherished was not in conformity with
papal decrees, and has with difficulty been squared with
the thirty-nine articles of the Anglican episcopacy. Separated
from the western world for a thousand years, they
were naturally ignorant of many novelties introduced by
the councils and decrees of the Lateran; and <i>their conformity
with the faith and practice of the first ages</i>, laid them
open to the unpardonable guilt of heresy and schism, as
estimated by the church of Rome. ‘We are Christians
and not idolaters,’ was their expressive reply when required
to do homage to the image of the Virgin Mary....
La Croze states them at fifteen hundred churches,
and as many towns and villages. They refused to recognize
the pope, and declared they had never heard of him;
they asserted the purity and primitive truth of their
faith since they came, and their bishops had for thirteen
hundred years been sent from the place where the followers
of Jesus were first called Christians.”<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Sabbatarian character of these Christians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
is hinted by Mr. Yeates. He says that Saturday
“amongst them is a festival day, <i>agreeable to
the ancient practice of the church</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<p>“The ancient practice of the church,” as we
have seen, was to hallow the seventh day in
memory of the Creator’s rest. This practice has
been suppressed wherever the great apostasy
has had power to do it. But the Christians of
the East Indies, like those of Abyssinia, have
lived sufficiently remote from Rome to be preserved
in some degree from its blasting influence.
The same fact is further hinted by the same
writer in the following language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The inquisition was set up at Goa in the Indies, at
the instance of Francis Xaverius [a famous Romish saint]
who signified by letters to Pope John III., Nov. 10, 1545,
‘That the <span class="smcap">Jewish wickedness</span> spread every day more and
more in the parts of the East Indies subject to the kingdom
of Portugal, and therefore he earnestly besought the said
king, that to cure so great an evil he would take care to
send the office of the inquisition into those countries.’”<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

</div>

<p>“The Jewish wickedness” was doubtless the
observance of Saturday as “a festival day agreeable
to the ancient practice of the church” of
which this author had just spoken. The history
of the past, as we have seen, shows the hatred
of the papal church toward the Sabbath. And
the struggle of that church to suppress the Sabbath
in Abyssinia, and to subject that people to
the pope which at this very point of time was
just commencing, shows that the Jesuits would
not willingly tolerate Sabbatic observance in the
East Indies, even though united with the observance
of Sunday also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span></p>

<p>It appears therefore that this Jesuit missionary
desired the pope and the king of Portugal to
establish the inquisition in that part of the Indies
subject to Portugal, in order to root out the Sabbath
from those ancient churches. The inquisition
was established in answer to this prayer,
and Xavier was subsequently canonized as a
saint! Nothing can more clearly show the malignity
of the Roman pontiff toward the Sabbath
of the Lord; and nothing more clearly illustrates
the kind of men that he canonizes as saints.</p>

<p>Since the time of Xavier, the East Indies have
fallen under British rule. A distinguished clergyman
of the church of England some years
since visited the British Empire in India, for
the purpose of acquainting himself with these
churches. He gave the following deeply interesting
sketch of these ancient Christians, and in
it particularly marks their Sabbatarian character:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The history of the Armenian church is very interesting.
Of all the Christians in Central Asia, they have
preserved themselves most free from Mahometan and papal
corruptions. The pope assailed them for a time with
great violence, but with little effect. The churches in
lesser Armenia indeed consented to an union, which did
not long continue; but those in Persian Armenia maintained
their independence; and they retain their ancient
Scriptures, doctrines, and worship, to this day. ‘It is
marvelous,’ says an intelligent traveler who was much
among them, ‘how the Armenian Christians have preserved
their faith, equally against the vexatious oppression
of the Mahometans, their sovereigns, and against
the persuasions of the Romish church, which for more
than two centuries has endeavored, by missionaries,
priests and monks, to attach them to her communion.
It is impossible to describe the artifices and expenses of
the court of Rome to effect this object, but all in vain.’</p>

<p>“The Bible was translated into the Armenian language<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
in the fifth century, under very auspicious circumstances,
the history of which has come down to us. It has been
allowed by competent judges of the language, to be a most
faithful translation. La Cruze calls it the ‘Queen of Versions.’
This Bible has ever remained in the possession of
the Armenian people; and many illustrious instances of
genuine and enlightened piety occur in their history....</p>

<p>“The Armenians in Hindoostan are our own subjects.
They acknowledge our government in India, as they do
that of the Sophi in Persia; and they are entitled to our
regard. They have preserved the Bible in its purity;
and their doctrines are, as far as the author knows, the
doctrines of the Bible. Besides, they maintain the solemn
observance of Christian worship throughout our empire,
<span class="smcap">on the seventh day</span>, and they have as many spires
pointing to heaven among the Hindoos as we ourselves.
Are such a people then entitled to no acknowledgment on
our part, as fellow Christians? Are they forever to be
ranked by us with Jews, Mahometans, and Hindoos?”<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It has been said, however, that Buchanan
might have intended Sunday by the term “seventh
day.” This is a very unreasonable interpretation
of his words. Episcopalian clergymen
are not accustomed to call Sunday the seventh
day. We have, however, testimony which cannot
with candor be explained away. It is that
of Purchas, written in the seventeenth century.
The author speaks of several sects of the eastern
Christians “continuing from ancient times,” as
Syrians, Jacobites, Nestorians, Maronites, and
Armenians. Of the Syrians, or Surians, as he
variously spells the name, who, from his relation,
appear to be identical with the Armenians, he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They keep Saturday holy, nor esteem Saturday fast
lawful but on Easter even. They have solemn service on
Saturdays, eat flesh, and feast it bravely like the Jews.”<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span></p>

<p>This author speaks of these Christians disrespectfully,
but he uses the uncandid statements
of their adversaries, which, indeed, are no worse
than those often made in these days concerning
those who hallow the Bible Sabbath. These
facts clearly attest the continued observance of
the Sabbath during the whole period of the Dark
Ages. The church of Rome was indeed able to
exterminate the Sabbath from its own communion,
but it was retained by the true people of
God, who were measurably hidden from the papacy
in the wilds of Central Europe; while those
African and East Indian churches, that were
never within the limits of the pope’s dominion,
have steadfastly retained the Sabbath to the
present day.</p>

<span class="smaller">POSITION OF THE REFORMERS CONCERNING THE SABBATH AND FIRST DAY.</span></h3>

<p>The Reformation arose in the Catholic church—The Sabbath
had been crushed out of that church, and innumerable festivals
established in its stead—Sunday as observed by

<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1601—How we should view the Reformers.</p>

</div>

<p>The great Reformation of the sixteenth century
arose from the bosom of the Catholic church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
itself. From that church the Sabbath had long
been extirpated; and instead of that merciful institution
ordained by the divine Law-giver for the
rest and refreshment of mankind, and that man
might acknowledge God as his Creator, the papacy
had ordained innumerable festivals, which,
as a terrible burden, crushed the people to the
earth. These festivals are thus enumerated by
Dr. Heylyn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These holy days as they were named particularly in
Pope Gregory’s decretal, so was a perfect list made of
them in the Synod of Lyons, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1244, which being celebrated
with a great concourse of people from all parts of
Christendom, the canons and decrees thereof began
forthwith to find a general admittance. The holy days
allowed of there, were these that follow; viz., the feast
of Christ’s nativity, St. Stephen, St. John the evangelist,
the Innocents, St. Sylvester, the circumcision of our
Lord, the Epiphany, Easter, together with the week precedent,
and the week succeeding, the three days in rogation
week, the day of Christ’s ascension, Whitsunday,
with the two days after, St. John the Baptist, the feasts
of all the twelve apostles, all the festivities of our Lady,
St. Lawrence, <span class="smcap">all the Lord’s days in the year</span>, St.
Michael the Archangel, All Saints, St. Martin’s, the
wakes, or dedication of particular churches, together with
the feasts of such topical or local saints which some particular
people had been pleased to honor with a day particular
amongst themselves. On these and every one of
them, the people were restrained as before was said from
many several kinds of work, on pain of ecclesiastical censures
to be laid on them which did offend, unless on some
emergent causes, either of charity or necessity they were
dispensed with for so doing.... Peter de Aliaco,
Cardinal of Cambray, in a discourse by him exhibited
to the council of Constance [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1416] made public suit
unto the fathers there assembled, that there might [be] a
stop in that kind hereafter; as also that excepting Sundays
and the greater festivals it might be lawful for the
people, after the end of divine service to attend their business;
the poor especially, as having little time enough
on the working days to get their living. But these were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
only the expressions of well-wishing men. The popes
were otherwise resolved, and did not only keep the holy
days which they found established, in the same state in
which they found them, but added others daily as they
saw occasion.... Thus stood it as before I said,
both for the doctrine and the practice, till men began to
look into the errors and abuses in the Roman church
with a more serious eye than before they did.”<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was the state of things when the reformers
began their labors. That they should give up
these festivals and return to the observance of
the ancient Sabbath, would be expecting too
much of men educated in the bosom of the Romish
church. Indeed, it ought not to surprise us
that, while they were constrained to strike down
the authority of these festivals, they should nevertheless
retain the most important of them in
their observance. The reformers spoke on this
matter as follows: The Confession of the Swiss
churches declares that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The observance of the Lord’s day is founded not on any
commandment of God, but on the authority of the church;
and, That the church may alter the day at pleasure.”<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We further learn that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the Augsburg Confession which was drawn up by
Melancthon [and approved by Luther], to the question,
‘What ought we to think of the Lord’s day?’ it is answered
that the Lord’s day, Easter, Whitsuntide, and
other such holy days, ought to be kept because they are
appointed by the church, that all things may be done in
order; but that the observance of them is not to be
thought necessary to salvation, nor the violation of them,
if it be done without offense to others, to be regarded as
a sin.”<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Zwingle declared “that it was lawful on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
Lord’s day, after divine service, for any man to
pursue his labors.”<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> Beza taught that “no cessation
of work on the Lord’s day is required of
Christians.”<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> Bucer goes further yet, “and doth
not only call it a superstition, but an apostasy
from Christ to think that working on the Lord’s
day, in itself considered, is a sinful thing.”<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> And
Cranmer, in his Catechism, published in 1548,
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We now keep no more the Sabbath on Saturday as
the Jews do; but we observe the Sunday, and certain
other days as the magistrates do judge convenient, whom
in this thing we ought to obey.”<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Tyndale said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As for the Sabbath, we be lords over the Sabbath,
and may yet change it into Monday, or into any other
day as we see need, or may make every tenth day holy
day only if we see cause why.”<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is plain that both Cranmer and Tyndale believed
that the ancient Sabbath was abolished,
and that Sunday was only a human ordinance
which it was in the power of the magistrates and
the church lawfully to change whenever they
saw cause for so doing. And Dr. Hessey gives
the opinion of Zwingle respecting the present
power of each individual church to transfer the
so-called Lord’s day to another day, whenever
necessity urges, as, for example, in harvest time.
Thus Zwingle says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If we would have the Lord’s day so bound to time
that it shall be wickedness to transfer it to another time,
in which resting from our labors equally as in that, we
may hear the word of God, if necessity haply shall so require,
this day so solicitously observed, would obtrude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
on us as a ceremony. For we are no way bound to time,
but time ought so to serve us, that it is lawful, and permitted
to each church, when necessity urges (as is usual
to be done in harvest time), to transfer the solemnity and
rest of the Lord’s day, or Sabbath, to some other day.”<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Zwingle could not, therefore, have considered
Sunday as a divinely appointed memorial of the
resurrection, or, indeed, as anything but a church
festival.</p>

<p>John Calvin said, respecting the origin of the
Sunday festival:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“However, the ancients have not without sufficient
reason substituted what <i>we</i> call the Lord’s day in the
room of the Sabbath. For since the resurrection of the
Lord is the end and consummation of that true rest,
which was adumbrated by the ancient Sabbath; the same
day which put an end to the shadows, admonishes Christians
not to adhere to a shadowy ceremony. Yet I do
not lay so much stress on the septenary number that I
would oblige the church to an invariable adherence to it;
nor will I condemn those churches, which have other solemn
days for their assemblies, provided they keep at a
distance from superstition.”<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is worthy of notice that Calvin does not assign
to Christ and his disciples the establishment of
Sunday in the place of the Sabbath. He says this
was done by the “ancients,”<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> or as another translates
it, “the old fathers.” Nor does he say “the
day which <i>John</i> called the Lord’s day,” but “the
day which <i>we</i> call the Lord’s day.” And what is
worthy of particular notice he did not insist that
the day which should be appropriated to worship
should be one day in every seven; for he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
not tied to “the septenary number.” The day
might come once in six days, or once in eight.
And this proves conclusively that he did not regard
Sunday as a divine institution in the proper
sense of the word; for if he had, he would most
assuredly have felt that the festival must be septenary,
that is, weekly, and that he must urge
“the church to an invariable adherence to it.”
But Calvin does not leave the matter here. He
condemns as “<span class="smcap">false prophets</span>” those who attempt
to enforce the Sunday festival by means of
the fourth commandment; and who to do this say
that the ceremonial part, which requires the observance
of the definite seventh day, is abolished,
while the moral part, which simply commands
the observance of one day in seven, still remains
in force. Here are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus vanish all the dreams of false prophets, who in
past ages have infected the people with a Jewish notion,
affirming that nothing but the ceremonial part of the commandment,
which according to them is the appointment
of the seventh day, has been abrogated, but that the
moral part of it, that is the observance of one day in
seven, still remains. But this is only changing the day
in contempt of the Jews, while they retain the same
opinion of the holiness of a day.”<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Yet these very “dreams of false prophets,” to
use the words of Calvin, constitute the foundation
of the modern doctrine of the change of the
Sabbath. For whatever may be said of first-day
sacredness in the New Testament, the fourth
commandment can only be made to recognize
that day by means of this very doctrine of one
day in seven which Calvin so sharply denounces.
Now I state another important fact. Calvin’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
commentaries on the New Testament cover all
the books from which quotations are made in behalf
of Sunday except the book of Revelation.
What does Calvin say concerning the change of
the Sabbath in the record of Christ’s resurrection?<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>
Not one word. He does not even hint
at any sacredness in the day, nor any commemoration
of the day. Does he say that the meeting
“after eight days” was upon Sunday? He does
not say what day it was.<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> What does he say of
Sunday in treating of the day of Pentecost?<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>
Nothing. He does not so much as say that this
festival was on the first day of the week. What
does he say of the breaking of bread at Troas?
He thinks it took place upon the ancient Sabbath!
He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Either he doth mean the first day of the week, which
was next after the Sabbath, or else some certain Sabbath.
Which latter thing may seem to me more probable; for
this cause, because <i>that day was more fit for an assembly,
according to custom</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He says, however, that this place might “very
well” be translated “the morrow after the Sabbath.”
But he adheres to his own translation,
“one day of the Sabbaths,” and not “first day of
the week.” He says further:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For to what end is there mentioned of the Sabbath,
save only that he may note the opportunity and choice of
the time? Also, it is a likely matter that Paul waited
for the Sabbath, that the day before his departure he
might the more easily gather all the disciples into one
place.”<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Therefore, I think thus, that they had appointed a
solemn day for the celebrating of the holy supper of the
Lord among themselves, which might be commodious for
them all.”<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This shows conclusively that Calvin believed
the Sabbath, and not the first day of the week,
to have been the day for meetings in the apostolic
church. But what does he say of the laying by
in store on the first day of the week? He says
that Paul’s precept relates, not to the first day of
the week, but to the Sabbath! And he marks
the Sabbath as the day on which the sacred assemblies
were held, and the communion celebrated,
and says that on account of these things
this was the most convenient day for collecting
their contribution. Thus he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>On one of the Sabbaths.</i> The end is this—that they
may have their alms ready in time. He therefore exhorts
them not to wait till he came, as any thing that is
done suddenly, and in a bustle, is not done well, but to
contribute on the Sabbath what might seem good, and
according as every one’s ability might enable—that is on
the day on which they held their sacred assemblies.<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></p>

<p>“For he has an eye, first of all, to convenience, and
farther, that the sacred assembly, in which the communion
of saints is celebrated, might be an additional spur to
them. Nor am I inclined to admit the view taken by
Chrysostom—that the term <i>Sabbath</i> is employed here to
mean the <i>Lord’s day</i> (Rev. 1:10), for the probability is,
that the apostles, at the beginning, retained the day that
was already in use, but that afterwards, constrained by
the superstition of the Jews, they set aside that day, and
substituted another. Now the <i>Lord’s day</i> was made
choice of chiefly because our Lord’s resurrection put an
end to the shadows of the law. Hence the day itself
puts us in mind of our Christian liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These words are very remarkable. They show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
first, that by the Sabbath day Calvin means, not
the first day, but the seventh; second, that in
his judgment as late as the time of this epistle,
and of the meeting at Troas [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 60], the Sabbath
was the day for the sacred assemblies of
the Christians, and for the celebration of the
communion; third, “but that <span class="smcap">afterwards</span>, constrained
by <span class="smcap">the superstition of the Jews</span>, they
set aside that day, and substituted another.”</p>

<p>Calvin did not therefore believe that Christ
changed the Sabbath to Sunday to commemorate
his resurrection; for he says that the resurrection
abolished the Sabbath,<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> and yet he believes that
the Sabbath was the sacred day of the Christians
to the entire exclusion of Sunday as late as the
year 60. Nor could he believe that the apostles
set apart Sunday to commemorate the resurrection
of Christ, for he thinks that they did not
make choice of that day till after the year 60,
and even then they did it merely because constrained
so to do by the superstition of the Jews!</p>

<p>Dr. Hessey illustrates Calvin’s ideas of Sunday
observance by the following incident:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Knox was the intimate friend of Calvin—visited Calvin,
and, it is said, on one occasion found him enjoying
the recreation of bowls on Sunday.”<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Without doubt Calvin was acting in exact harmony
with his ideas of the nature of the Sunday
festival. But the famous case of Michael Servetus
furnishes us a still more pointed illustration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
of his views of the sacredness of that day.
Servetus was arrested in Geneva on the personal
application of John Calvin to the magistrates of
that city. Such is the statement of Theodore
Beza, the life-long friend of Calvin.<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> Beza’s
translator adds to this fact the following remarkable
statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Promptness induced him to have this heresiarch arrested
on a Sunday.”<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same fact is stated by Robinson:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“While he waited for a boat to cross the lake in his
way to Zurich, by some means Calvin got intelligence of
his arrival; and although it was on a Sunday, yet he prevailed
upon the chief syndic to arrest and imprison him.
On that day by the laws of Geneva no person could be
arrested except for a capital crime; but this difficulty
was easily removed, for John Calvin pretended that Servetus
was a heretic, and that heresy was a capital crime.”<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<p>“The doctor was arrested and imprisoned on Sunday
the thirteenth of August [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1553]. That very day he
was brought into court.”<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Calvin’s own words respecting the arrest are
these:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will not deny but that he was made prisoner upon
my application.”<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The warmest friends of first-day sacredness
will not deny that the least sinful part of this
transaction was that it occurred on Sunday.
Nevertheless the fact that Calvin caused the arrest
of Servetus on that day shows that he had
no conviction that the day possessed any inherent
sacredness.</p>

<p>John Barclay,<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> a learned man of Scotch descent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
and a moderate Roman Catholic, who was born
soon after the death of Calvin, and whose early
life was spent in eastern France, not very remote
from Geneva, published the statement that Calvin
and his friends at Geneva</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Debated whether the reformed, for the purpose of
estranging themselves more completely from the Romish
church, should not adopt Thursday as the Christian Sabbath.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another reason assigned by Calvin for this
proposed change was,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it would be a proper instance of Christian liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This statement has been credited by many
learned Protestants,<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> some of whom must be acknowledged
as men of candor and judgment.
But Dr. Twisse<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> discredits Barclay because he did
not name the individuals with whom Calvin consulted,
and produce them as witnesses; and because
that King James I. of England at one time
suspected Barclay of treachery toward him. But
no such crime was ever proved, nor does it appear
that the king continued always to hold him
in that light.<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> His veracity has never been impeached.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
The statement of Barclay may possibly
be incorrect, but it is not inconsistent with
Calvin’s doctrine that the church is not tied to a
festival that should come once in <i>seven</i> days, even
as Tyndale said that they could change the Sabbath
into Monday or could “make every tenth
day holy day, only if we see cause why,” and it is
in perfect harmony with Calvin’s idea of Sunday
sacredness as shown in his acts already noticed.
Like the other reformers, Calvin is not always
consistent with himself in his statements. Nevertheless,
we have his judgment concerning the
several texts which are used to prove the change
of the Sabbath, and also respecting the theory
that the commandment may be used to enforce,
not the seventh day, but one day in seven, and
it is fatal to the modern first-day doctrine.</p>

<p>John Knox, the great Scottish reformer, was
the intimate friend of Calvin, with whom he
lived at Geneva during a portion of his exile from
Scotland. Though the foundation of the Presbyterian
church of Scotland was laid by Knox, or
rather by Calvin, for Knox carried out Calvin’s
system, and though that church is now very strict
in the observance of Sunday as the Sabbath, yet
Knox himself was of Calvin’s mind as to the obligation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
of that day. The original Confession of
Faith of that church was drawn up by Knox in
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1560.<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> In that document Knox states the
duties of the first table of the law as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To have one God, to worship and honor him; to call
upon him in all our troubles; to reverence his holy name;
to hear his word; to believe the same; to communicate
with his holy sacraments, are the works of the first table.”<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is plain that Knox believed the Sabbath
commandment to have been stricken out of the
first table. Dr. Hessey, after speaking of certain
references to Sunday in a subsequent work of his,
makes this statement respecting the present doctrine
of the Sabbath in the Presbyterian church:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the whole, whatever the language held at present
in Scotland may be, it is certainly not owing to the great
man whom the Scotch regard as the apostle of the Reformation
in their country.”<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That church now holds Sunday to be the divinely
authorized memorial of the resurrection of
Christ, enforced by the authority of the fourth
commandment. But not thus was it held by
Calvin and Knox. A British writer states the
condition of things with respect to Sunday in
Scotland about the year 1601:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At the commencement of the seventeenth century,
tailors, shoemakers, and bakers in Aberdeen were accustomed
to work till eight or nine every Sunday morning.
While violation of the prescribed ritual observances was
punished by fine, the exclusive consecration of the Sunday
which subsequently prevailed was then unknown.
Indeed, there were regular ‘play Sundays’ in Scotland
till the end of the sixteenth century.”<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span></p>

<p>But the Presbyterian church, after Knox’s time,
effected an entire change with respect to Sunday
observance. The same writer says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Presbyterian Kirk introduced into Scotland the
Judaical observance of the Sabbath [Sunday], retaining
with some inconsistency the Sunday festival of the Catholic
church, while rejecting all the other feasts which its
authority had consecrated.”<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Hessey shows the method of doing this.
He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of course some difficulties had to be got over. The
Sabbath was the seventh day, Sunday was the first day
of the week. But an ingenious theory that one day in
seven was the essence of the fourth commandment speedily
reconciled them to this.”<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The circumstances under which this new doctrine
was framed, the name of its author, and the
date of its publication, will be given in their
place. That the body of the reformers should
have failed to recognize the authority of the
fourth commandment, and that they did not
turn men from the Romish festivals to the Sabbath
of the Lord, is a matter of regret rather
than of surprise. The impropriety of making
them the standard of divine truth is forcibly set
forth in the following language:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Luther and Calvin reformed many abuses, especially
in the discipline of the church, and also some gross corruptions
in doctrine; but they left other things of far
greater moment just as they found them.... It was
great merit in them to go as far as they did, and it is not
they but we who are to blame if their authority induce
us to go no further. We should rather imitate them in
the boldness and spirit with which they called in question
and rectified so many long-established errors; and
availing ourselves of their labors, make further progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
than they were able to do. Little reason have we to allege
their name, authority, and example, when they did a
great deal and we do nothing at all. In this we are not
imitating them, but those who opposed and counteracted
them, willing to keep things as they were.”<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is worthy of notice that at least one of the
reformers of considerable prominence—Carlstadt—was
a Sabbatarian. It is impossible to read<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
the records of the Reformation without the conviction
that Carlstadt was desirous of a more
thorough work of reformation than was Luther.
And that while Luther was disposed to tolerate
certain abuses lest the Reformation should be endangered,
Carlstadt was at all hazards for a complete
return to the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>The Sabbatarian principles of Carlstadt, his
intimate connection with Luther, his prominence
in the early history of the Reformation, and the
important bearing of Luther’s decision concerning
the Sabbath upon the entire history of the
Protestant church, render the former worthy of
notice in the history of the Sabbath. We shall
give his record in the exact words of the best
historians, none of whom were in sympathy with
his observance of the seventh day. The manner
in which they state his faults shows that they
were not partial toward him. Shortly after Luther
began to preach against the merit of good
works, his deep interest in the work of delivering
men from popish thralldom led him to deny
the inspiration of some portion of those scriptures
which were quoted against him. Dr. Sears
thus states the case:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Luther was so zealous to maintain the doctrine of
justification by faith, that he was prepared even to call
in question the authority of some portions of Scripture,
which seemed to him not to be reconcilable with it. To
the Epistle of James, especially, his expressions indicate
the strongest repugnance.”<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Before Luther’s captivity in the castle of Wartburg,
a dispute had arisen between himself and
Carlstadt on this very subject. It is recorded of
Carlstadt that in the year 1520,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He published a treatise ‘Concerning the Canon of
Scripture,’ which, although defaced by bitter attacks on
Luther, was nevertheless an able work, setting forth the
great principle of Protestantism, viz., the paramount authority
of Scripture. He also at this time contended for
the authority of the Epistle of St. James, against Luther.
On the publication of the bull of Leo X. against the reformers,
Carlstadt showed a real and honest courage in
standing firm with Luther. His work on ‘Papal Sanctity’
(1520) attacks the infallibility of the pope on the basis
of the Bible.”<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Luther, as is well known, while returning from
the Diet of Worms, was seized by the agents of
the Elector of Saxony, and hidden from his enemies
in Wartburg Castle. We read of Carlstadt
at this time as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In 1521, during Luther’s confinement in the Wartburg,
Carlstadt had almost sole control of the reform
movement at Wittemberg, and was supreme in the university.
He attacked monachism and celibacy in a treatise
‘Concerning Celibacy, Monachism, and Widowhood.’
His next point of assault was the Mass, and a riot of students
and young citizens against the Mass soon followed.
On Christmas, 1521, he gave the sacrament in both kinds
to the laity, and in German; and in January, 1522, he
married. His headlong zeal led him to do whatever he
came to believe right, at once and arbitrarily. But he
soon outran Luther, and one of his great mistakes was in
putting the Old Testament on the same footing as the
New. On Jan. 24, 1522, Carlstadt obtained the adoption
of a new church constitution at Wittemberg, which is of
interest only as the first Protestant organization of the
Reformation.”<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There were present at this time in Wittemberg
certain fanatical teachers, who, from the
town whence they came, were called “the prophets
of Zwickau.” They brought Carlstadt for a
time so far under their influence, that he concluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
academical degrees to be sinful, and that,
as the inspiration of the Spirit was sufficient,
there was no need of human learning. He therefore
advised the students of the university to
return to their homes.<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> That institution was in
danger of dissolution. Such was Carlstadt’s
course in Luther’s absence. With the exception
of this last movement, his acts were in themselves
right.</p>

<p>The changes made at Wittemberg during Luther’s
absence, whether timely or not, are generally
set down to Carlstadt’s account, and said to
have been made by him on his individual responsibility,
and in a fanatical manner. But
this was quite otherwise. Dr. Maclaine thus
states the case:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The reader may perhaps imagine, from Dr. Mosheim’s
account of this matter, that Carlstadt introduced
these changes merely by his own authority; but this was
far from being the case; the suppression of private masses,
the removal of images out of the churches, the abolition
of the law which imposed celibacy upon the clergy;
which are the changes hinted at by our historian as rash
and perilous, were effected by Carlstadt, in conjunction
with Bugenhagius, Melancthon, Jonas Amsdorf, and
others, and were confirmed by the authority of the Elector
of Saxony; so that there is some reason to apprehend
that one of the principal causes of Luther’s displeasure
at these changes, was their being introduced in his absence;
unless we suppose that he had not so far shaken
off the fetters of superstition, as to be sensible of the
absurdity and the pernicious consequences of the use of
images.”<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Carlstadt had given the cup to the laity of
which they had long been deprived by Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
He had set aside the worship of the consecrated
bread. Dr. Sears rehearses this work of Carlstadt,
and then tells us what Luther did concerning
it on his return. These are his words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He [Carlstadt] had so far restored the sacrament of
the Lord’s supper as to distribute the wine as well as the
bread to the laity. Luther, ‘in order not to offend weak
consciences,’ insisted on distributing the bread only,
and prevailed. He [Carlstadt] rejected the practice of
elevating and adoring the host. Luther allowed it, and
introduced it again.”<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The position of Carlstadt was at this time very
trying. He had not received “many things
taught by the new teachers” from Zwickau. But
he had publicly taught some of their fanatical
ideas relative to the influence of the Spirit of
God superseding the necessity of study. But in
the suppression of the idolatrous services of the
Romanists, he was essentially right. He had the
pain to see much of this set up again. Moreover
the elector would not allow him either to preach
or write upon the points wherein he differed from
Luther. D’Aubigné states his course thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nevertheless, he sacrificed his self-love for the sake
of peace, restrained his desire to vindicate his doctrine,
was reconciled, at least in appearance, to his colleague
[Luther], and soon after resumed his studies in the university.”<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As Luther taught some doctrines which Carlstadt
could not approve, he felt at last that he
must speak. Dr. Sears thus writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After Carlstadt had been compelled to keep silence,
from 1522 to 1524, and to submit to the superior power
and authority of Luther, he could contain himself no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
longer. He, therefore, left Wittemberg, and established
a press at Jena, through which he could, in a series of
publications, give vent to his convictions, so long pent
up.”<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The principles at the foundation of their ideas
of the Reformation were these: Carlstadt insisted
on rejecting everything in the Catholic church
not authorized in the Bible; Luther was determined
to retain everything not expressly forbidden.
Dr. Sears thus states their primary differences:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Carlstadt maintained, that ‘we should not, in things
pertaining to God, regard what the multitude say or
think, but look simply to the word of God. Others,’ he
adds, ‘say that, on account of the weak, we should not
<i>hasten</i> to keep the commands of God; but wait till they
become wise and strong.’ In regard to the ceremonies
introduced into the church, he judged as the Swiss reformers
did, that all were to be rejected which had not a
warrant in the Bible. ‘It is sufficiently against the Scriptures
if you can find no ground for it in them.’</p>

<p>“Luther asserted, on the contrary, ‘Whatever is not
against the Scriptures is for the Scriptures, and the Scriptures
for it. Though Christ hath not commanded adoring
of the host, so neither hath he forbidden it.’ ‘Not
so,’ said Carlstadt, ‘we are bound to the Bible, and no
one may decide after the thoughts of his own heart.’”<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is of interest to know what was the subject
which caused the controversy between them, and
what was the position of each. Dr. Maclaine
thus states the occasion of the conflict which
now arose:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This difference of opinion between Carlstadt and Luther
concerning the eucharist, was the true cause of the
violent rupture between those two eminent men, and it
tended very little to the honor of the latter; for, however
the explication, which the former gave of the words of the
institution of the Lord’s supper, may appear forced, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
the sentiments he entertained of that ordinance as a commemoration
of Christ’s death, and not as a celebration of
his bodily presence, in consequence of a consubstantiation
with the bread and wine, are infinitely more rational
than the doctrine of Luther, which is loaded with some
of the most palpable absurdities of transubstantiation;
and if it be supposed that Carlstadt strained the rule of
interpretation too far, when he alleged, that Christ pronounced
the pronoun <i>this</i> (in the words <i>This is my body</i>)
pointing to his body, and not to the bread, what shall we
think of Luther’s explaining the nonsensical doctrine of
consubstantiation by the similitude of a red-hot iron, in
which two elements are united, as the body of Christ is
with the bread of the eucharist?”<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Sears also states the occasion of this conflict
in 1524:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The most important difference between him and Luther,
and that which most embittered the latter against
him, related to the Lord’s supper. He opposed not only
transubstantiation, but consubstantiation, the real presence,
and the elevation and adoration of the host. Luther
rejected the first, asserted the second and third, and allowed
the other two. In regard to the real presence, he
says: ‘In the sacrament is the real body of Christ and
the real blood of Christ, so that even the unworthy and
ungodly partake of it; and “partake of it corporally”
too, and not spiritually as Carlstadt will have it.’”<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That Luther was the one chiefly in error in
this controversy will be acknowledged by nearly
every one at the present day. D’Aubigné cannot
refrain from censuring him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When once the question of the supper was raised,
Luther threw away the proper element of the Reformation,
and took his stand for <i>himself</i> and <i>his church</i> in an <i>exclusive
Lutheranism</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span></p>

<p>The controversy is thus characterized by Dr.
Sears:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A furious controversy ensued. Both parties exceeded
the bounds of Christian propriety and moderation.
Carlstadt was now in the vicinity of the Anabaptist tumults,
excited by Muntzer. He sympathized with them
in some things, but disapproved of their disorders. Luther
made the most of this.”<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is evident that in this contest Luther did
not gain any decisive advantage, even in the estimation
of his friends. The Elector of Saxony
interfered and banished Carlstadt! D’Aubigné
thus states the case:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He issued orders to deprive Carlstadt of his appointments,
and banished him, not only from Orlamund, but
from the States of the electorate.”<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>“Luther had nothing to do with this sternness on the
part of the prince: it was foreign to his disposition,—and
this he afterward proved.”<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Carlstadt, for maintaining the doctrine now held
by almost all Protestants, concerning the supper,
and for denying Luther’s doctrine that Christ is
personally present in the bread, was rendered a
homeless wanderer for years. His banishment
was in 1524. What followed is thus described:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From this date until 1534 he wandered through
Germany, pursued by the persecuting opinions of both
Lutherans and Papists, and at times reduced to great
straits by indigence and unpopularity. But, although he
always found sympathy and hospitality among the Anabaptists,
yet he is evidently clear of the charge of complicity
with Muntzer’s rebellion. Yet he was forbidden
to write, his life was sometimes in danger, and he exhibits
the melancholy spectacle of a man great and right in
many respects, but whose rashness, ambition, and insincere
zeal, together with many fanatical opinions, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
put him under the well-founded but immoderate censure
of both friends and foes.”<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such language seems quite unwarranted by the
facts. There was no justice in this persecution
of Carlstadt. He did for a brief time hold some
fanatical ideas, but these he did not afterward
maintain. The same writer speaks further in the
same strain:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It cannot be denied that in many respects he was apparently
in advance of Luther, but his error lay in his
haste to subvert and abolish the external forms and
pomps before the hearts of the people, and doubtless his
own, were prepared by an internal change. Biographies
of him are numerous, and the Reformation no doubt owes
him much of good for which he has not the credit, as it
was overshadowed by the mischief he produced.”<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Important truth relative to the services of
Carlstadt is here stated, but it is connected with
intimations of evil which have no sufficient foundation
in fact. Dr. Sears speaks thus of the bitter
language concerning him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For three centuries, Carlstadt’s moral character has
been treated somewhat as Luther’s would have been, if
only Catholic testimony had been heard. The party interested
has been both witness and judge. What if we
were to judge of Zwingle’s Christian character by Luther’s
representations? The truth is, Carlstadt hardly
showed a worse spirit, or employed more abusive terms
toward Luther, than Luther did toward him. Carlstadt
knew that in many things the truth was on his side; and
yet, in these, no less than in others, he was crushed by
the civil power, which was on the side of Luther.”<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

</div>

<p>D’Aubigné speaks thus of the contest between
these two men:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Each turns against the error which, to his mind,
seems most noxious, and in assailing it, goes—it may be—beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
the truth. But this being admitted, it is still
true that both are right in the prevailing turn of their
thoughts, and though ranking in different hosts, the two
great teachers are nevertheless found under the same
standard—that of Jesus Christ, who alone is <span class="smcap">truth</span> in
the full import of that word.”<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a></p>

</div>

<p>D’Aubigné says of them after Carlstadt had
been banished:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is impossible not to feel a pain at contemplating
these two men, once friends, and both worthy of our esteem,
thus angrily opposed.”<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sometime after Carlstadt’s banishment from
Saxony he visited Switzerland. D’Aubigné speaks
of the result of his labors in that country, and
what Luther did toward him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“His instructions soon attracted an attention nearly
equal to that which had been excited by the earliest theses
put forth by Luther. Switzerland seemed almost gained
over to his doctrine. Bucer and Capito also appeared to
adopt his views.</p>

<p>“Then it was that Luther’s indignation rose to its
hight; and he put forth one of the most powerful but also
most <span class="smcap">outrageous</span> of his controversial writings,—his
book ‘<i>Against the Celestial Prophets</i>.’”<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Sears also mentions the labors of Carlstadt
in Switzerland, and speaks of Luther’s uncandid
book:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The work which he wrote against him, he entitled
‘The book against the Celestial Prophets.’ This was uncandid;
for the controversy related chiefly to the sacrament
of the supper. In the south of Germany and in
Switzerland, Carlstadt found more adherents than Luther.
Banished as an Anabaptist, he was received as a Zwinglian.”<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Maclaine tells something which followed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
which is worthy of the better nature of these two
illustrious men:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Carlstadt, after his banishment from Saxony, composed
a treatise against enthusiasm in general, and against the
extravagant tenets and the violent proceedings of the Anabaptists
in particular. This treatise was even addressed
to Luther, who was so affected by it, that, repenting of
his unworthy treatment of Carlstadt, he pleaded his cause,
and obtained from the elector a permission for him to return
into Saxony.”<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

<p>“After this reconciliation with Luther, he composed a
treatise on the eucharist, which breathes the most amiable
spirit of moderation and humility; and having perused
the writings of Zwingle, where he saw his own sentiments
on that subject maintained with the greatest perspicuity
and force of evidence, he repaired the second time to Zurich,
and thence to Basil, where he was admitted to the
offices of pastor and professor of divinity, and where, after
having lived in the exemplary and constant practice of
every Christian virtue, he died, amidst the warmest effusions
of piety and resignation, on the 25th of December,
1541.”<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of Carlstadt’s scholarship, and of his conscientiousness,
D’Aubigné speaks thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘He was well acquainted,’ says Dr. Scheur, ‘with Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew;’ and Luther acknowledged him to
be his superior in learning. Endowed with great powers
of mind, he sacrificed to his convictions fame, station,
country, and even his bread.”<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></p>

</div>

<p>His Sabbatarian character is attested by Dr.
White, lord bishop of Ely:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The same [the observance of the seventh day] likewise
being revived in Luther’s time by Carolastadius,
Sternebergius, and by some sectaries among the Anabaptists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
hath both then and ever since been censured as Jewish
and heretical.”<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Sears alludes to Carlstadt’s observance of
the seventh day, but as is quite usual with first-day
historians in such cases, does it in such a
manner as to leave the fact sufficiently obscure
to be passed over without notice by the general
reader. He writes thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Carlstadt differed essentially from Luther in regard
to the use to be made of the Old Testament. With him,
the law of Moses was still binding. Luther, on the contrary,
had a strong aversion to what he calls a legal and
Judaizing religion. Carlstadt held to the divine authority
of the Sabbath from the Old Testament; Luther believed
Christians were free to observe any day as a Sabbath,
provided they be uniform in observing it.”<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We have, however, Luther’s own statement respecting
Carlstadt’s views of the Sabbath. It is
from his book “Against the Celestial Prophets:”—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Indeed, if Carlstadt were to write further about the
Sabbath, Sunday would have to give way, and the Sabbath—that
is to say, Saturday—must be kept holy; he
would truly make us Jews in all things, and we should
come to be circumcised: for that is true, and cannot be
denied, that he who deems it necessary to keep one law
of Moses, and keeps it as the law of Moses, must deem all
necessary, and keep them all.”<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The various historians who treat of the difficulty
between Luther and Carlstadt, speak freely
of the motives of each. But of such matters it is
best to speak little; the day of Judgment will
show the hearts of men, and we must wait till
then. We may, however, freely speak of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
acts, and may with propriety name the things
wherein each would have benefited the other.
Carlstadt’s errors at Wittemberg were not because
he rejected Luther’s help, but because he was deprived
of it by Luther’s captivity. Luther’s error
in those things wherein Carlstadt was right
were because he saw it best to reject Carlstadt’s
doctrine.</p>

<p>1. Carlstadt’s error in the removal of the images,
the suppression of masses, the abolition of
monastic vows, or vows of celibacy, and in giving
the wine as well as the bread in the supper, and
in performing the service in German instead of
Latin, if it was an error, was one of time rather
than of doctrine. Had Luther been with him,
probably all would have been deferred for some
months or perhaps some years.</p>

<p>2. Carlstadt would probably have been saved
by Luther’s presence from coming under the influence
of the Zwickau prophets. As it was, he
did for a brief season accept, not their teaching in
general, but their doctrine that the inspiration
of the Holy Spirit in believers renders human
learning vain and worthless. But in both these
things Carlstadt submitted to Luther’s correction.
Had Luther regarded Carlstadt, he would have
been benefited in the following particulars:—</p>

<p>1. In his zeal for the doctrine of justification
by faith, he would have been saved from the denial
of the inspiration of the epistle of James,
and would not have called it a “strawy or chaffy
epistle.”<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p>2. Instead of exchanging transubstantiation,
which is the Romish doctrine that the bread and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
wine of the supper become Christ’s literal flesh
and blood, for consubstantiation, the doctrine
which he fastened upon the Lutheran church
that Christ’s flesh and blood are actually present
<i>in</i> the bread and wine, he would have given to
that church the doctrine that the bread and wine
simply represent the body and blood of Christ,
and are used in commemoration of his sacrifice
for our sins.</p>

<p>3. Instead of holding fast every thing in the
Romish church not expressly forbidden in the
Bible, he would have laid all aside which had
not the actual sanction of that holy book.</p>

<p>4. Instead of the Catholic festival of Sunday,
he would have observed and transmitted to the
Protestant church the ancient Sabbath of the
Lord.</p>

<p>Carlstadt needed Luther’s help, and he accepted
it. Did not Luther also need that of Carlstadt?
Is it not time that Carlstadt should be
vindicated from the great obloquy thrown upon
him by the prevailing party? And would not
this have been done long since had not Carlstadt
been a decided Sabbatarian?</p>

<p>The judgment of the martyr Frith—The Reformation brings
Sabbath-keepers to light in various countries—In Transylvania—In
Bohemia—In Russia—In Germany—In Holland—In
France—In England.</p>

</div>

<p>John Frith, an English reformer of considerable
note and a martyr, was converted by the labors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
of Tyndale about 1525, and assisted him in
the translation of the Bible. He was burned at
Smithfield, July 4, 1533. He is spoken of in the
highest terms by the historians of the English
Reformation.<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> His views respecting the Sabbath
and first-day are thus stated by himself:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Jews have the word of God for their Saturday,
sith [since] it is the seventh day, and they were commanded
to keep the seventh day solemn. And we have
not the word of God for us, but rather against us; for we
keep not the seventh day, as the Jews do, but the first,
which is not commanded by God’s law.”<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a></p>

</div>

<p>When the Reformation had lifted the vail of
darkness that covered the nations of Europe,
Sabbath-keepers were found in Transylvania,
Bohemia, Russia, Germany, Holland, France, and
England. It was not the Reformation which
gave existence to these Sabbatarians, for the
leaders of the Reformation, as a body, were not
friendly to such views. On the contrary, these
observers of the Sabbath appear to be remnants
of the ancient Sabbath-keeping churches that had
witnessed for the truth during the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>Transylvania, a country which now constitutes
one of the eastern divisions of the Austrian Empire,
was, in the sixteenth century, an independent
principality. About the middle of that
century, the country was under the rule of Sigismund.
The historian of the Baptists, Robinson,
gives the following interesting record of events
in that age and country:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“The prince received his first religious impressions
under his chaplain, Alexius, who was a Lutheran. On
his removal he chose Francis Davidis to succeed him, and
by him was further informed of the principles of the Reformation.
Davidis was a native of that extremely populous
and well-fortified town which is called Coloswar by
the natives, Clausenberg by the Germans, and by others,
Claudiopolis. He was a man of learning, address, and
piety, and reasoned in this part of his life more justly on
the principles of the Reformation than many of his cotemporaries.
In 1563 his highness invited several learned
foreigners to come into Transylvania for the purpose of
helping forward the Reformation.<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>“Several other foreigners, who had been persecuted
elsewhere, sought refuge in this country, where persecution
for religion was unknown. These refugees were
Unitarian Baptists, and through their indefatigable industry
and address, the prince, the greatest part of the
senate, a great number of ministers, and a multitude
of the people went heartily into their plan of Reformation.<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a></p>

<p>“In the end the Baptists became by far the most numerous
party, and were put in possession of a printing
office, and an academy, and the cathedral was given to
them for a place of worship. They obtained these without
any violence, and while they formed their own churches
according to the convictions of their members, they persecuted
nobody, but allowed the same liberty to others,
and great numbers of Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists
resided in perfect freedom.”<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Robinson further informs us that Davidis
took extreme Unitarian ground with respect to
the worship of Christ, which seems to have been
the only serious error that can be laid to his
charge. Davidis was a Unitarian Baptist minister,
intrusted by his brethren with the superintendency
of the churches in Transylvania.
His influence in that country at one period was
very great. His views of the Sabbath are thus
stated:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He supposed the Jewish Sabbath not abrogated, and
he therefore kept holy the seventh day. He believed
also the doctrine of the millennium, and like an honest
man, what he believed he taught. He was considered by
the Transylvanian churches as an apostle, and had grown
gray in their service; but the Catholics, the Lutherans,
and the Calvinists, thought him a Turk, a blasphemer,
and an atheist, and his Polish Baptist brethren said he
was half a Jew. Had he been a whole Jew he ought not
to have been imprisoned for his speculations.<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a></p>

<p>“By what means the Supreme Searcher of hearts only
knows, but by some methods till then unknown in Transylvania,
the old man was arrested, and by the senate
condemned to die. He was imprisoned in the castle, and
providence by putting a period to his life there, saved
his persecutors from the disgrace of a public execution.”<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Robinson says that “many have been
blamed” for the death of Davidis, “but perhaps
the secret springs of this event may never be
known till the Judge of the world maketh inquisition
for blood.” There were many Sabbatarians
in Transylvania at this time, for Mr. Robinson
enumerates many persons of distinction
who were of the same views with Davidis. The
ambassador Bequessius, general of the army;
the princess, sister of prince John; the privy
counselor, Chaquius, and the two Quendi; general
Andrassi, and many others of high rank; Somer,
the rector of the academy at Claudiopolis; Matthias
Glirius, Adam Neusner, and Christian
Francken, a professor an the academy at Claudiopolis.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These,” says Robinson, “were all of the same sentiments
as Davidis, as were many more of different ranks,
who after his death in prison, defended his opinion against
Socinus. Palæologus was of the same mind; he had fled
into Moravia, but was caught by the emperor, at the request
of Pope Gregory XIV., and carried to Rome, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
he was burnt for a heretick. He was an old man, and
was terrified at first into a recantation, but he recollected
himself and submitted to his fate like a Christian.”<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These persons must have been Sabbatarians.
Mosheim, after saying that Davidis “left behind
him disciples and friends, who strenuously maintained
his sentiments,” adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The most eminent of these were Jacob Palæologus, of
the isle of Chio, who was burned at Rome in 1585; Christian
Francken, who had disputed in person with Socinus;
and John Somer, who was master of the academy of
Clausenberg. This little sect is branded by the Socinian
writers, with the ignominious appellation of <span class="smcap">Semi-Judaizers</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We have a further record of Sabbatarians in
Transylvania to the effect that in the time of
Davidis,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“John Gerendi [was] head of the Sabbatarians, a people
who did not keep Sunday but Saturday, and whose
disciples took the name of Genoldists.”<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sabbath-keepers, also, were found in Bohemia,
a country of Central Europe, at the time of the
Reformation. We are dependent upon those
who despised their faith and practice for a
knowledge of their existence. Erasmus speaks
of them as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now we hear that among the Bohemians a new kind
of Jews has arisen called Sabbatarians, who observe the
Sabbath with so much superstition, that if on that day
anything falls into their eyes they will not remove it; as
if the Lord’s day would not suffice for them instead of
the Sabbath, which to the apostles also was sacred; or as
if Christ had not sufficiently expressed how much should
be allowed upon the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span></p>

<p>We need say nothing relative to the alleged superstition
of these Sabbath-keepers. The statement
sufficiently refutes itself, and indicates the
bitter prejudice of those who speak of them thus.
But that Sabbath-keepers were found at this
time in Bohemia admits of no doubt. They
were of some importance, and they must also
have published their views to the world; for
Cox tells us that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hospinian of Zurich, in his treatise ‘Concerning the
Feasts of the Jews and of the Gentiles,’ chapter iii. (Tiguri,
1592) replies to the arguments of these Sabbatarians.”<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The existence of this body of Sabbatarians in
Bohemia at the time of the Reformation is strong
presumptive proof that the Waldenses of Bohemia,
noticed in the preceding chapter, though
claimed as observers of Sunday, were actually
observers of the ancient Sabbath.</p>

<p>In Russia, the observers of the seventh day are
numerous at the present time. Their existence
can be traced back nearly to the year 1400.
They are, therefore, at least one hundred years
older than the work of Luther. The first writer
that I quote speaks of them as “having left the
Christian faith.” But even in our time, it is very
common for people to speak of those who turn
from the first day to the seventh that they have
renounced Christ for Moses.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> He also speaks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
them as holding to circumcision. Even Carlstadt
was charged with this by Luther as a necessary
deduction from the fact that he observed the day
enjoined in the fourth commandment. Such being
a common method of characterizing Sabbath-keepers
in our time, and such also having been
the case in past ages—for when men lack argument,
they use opprobrious terms—the historian,
who makes up his record of these people from
the statements of the popular party, will certainly
represent them as rejecting Christ and the
gospel, and accepting instead Moses and the ceremonial
law. I give the statements of the historians
as they are, and the reader must judge.
Robert Pinkerton gives the following account of
them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Seleznevtschini.</i> This sect are, in modern time, precisely
what the Strigolniks originally were. They are
Jews in principle; maintain the divine obligation of circumcision;
observe the Jewish Sabbath, and the ceremonial
law. There are many of them about Tula, on the
river Kuma, and in other provinces, and they are very
numerous in Poland and Turkey, where, having left the
Christian faith, they have joined the seed of Abraham,
according to the flesh, in rejecting the Messiah and the
gospel.”<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The ancient Russian name of this people was
<i>Strigolniks</i>. Dr. Murdock gives the following
account of them:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is common to date the origin of sectarians in the
Russian church, about the middle of the seventeenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
in the time of the patriarch Nikon. But according
to the Russian annals, there existed schismatics in the
Russian church two hundred years before the days of
Nikon; and the disturbances which took place in his
time, only proved the means of augmenting their numbers,
and of bringing them forward into public view.
The earliest of these schismatics first appeared in Novogorod,
early in the fifteenth century, under the name of
<i>Strigolniks</i>.</p>

<p>“A Jew named Horie preached a mixture of Judaism
and Christianity; and proselyted two priests, Denis and
Alexie, who gained a vast number of followers. This
sect was so numerous, that a national council was called,
towards the close of the fifteenth century, to oppose it.
Soon afterwards, one Karp, an excommunicated deacon,
joined the <i>Strigolniks</i>; and accused the higher clergy of
selling the office of priesthood, and of so far corrupting
the church, that the Holy Ghost was withdrawn from it.
He was a very successful propagator of this sect.”<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is very customary with historians to speak
of Sabbath-keeping Christians in one of the following
ways: 1. To name their observance of the
seventh day distinctly, but to represent them as
turning from Christ to Moses and the ceremonial
law; or, 2. To speak of their Sabbatarian principles
in so vague a manner that the reader will
not be likely to suspect them of being Sabbath-keepers.
Pinkerton speaks of these Russian
Sabbath-keepers after the first of these methods;
Murdock, after the second. It is plain that Murdock
did not regard these people as rejecting
Christ, and it is certain from Pinkerton that the
two writers are speaking of the same people.</p>

<p>What was the origin of these Russian Sabbath-keepers?
Certainly it was not from the Reformation
of the sixteenth century; for they were
in existence at least one century before that event.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
We have seen that the Waldenses, during the
Dark Ages, were dispersed through many of the
countries of Europe. And so also were the people
called Cathari, if, indeed, the two were not one people.
In particular, we note the fact that they were
scattered through Poland, Lithuania, Sclavonia,
Bulgaria, Livonia, Albania, and Sarmatia.<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> These
countries are now parts of the Russian Empire.
Sabbath-keepers were numerous in Russia before
the time of Luther. The Sabbath of the Lord
was certainly retained by many of the ancient
Waldenses and Cathari, as we have seen. In
fact, the very things said of the Russian Sabbath-keepers,
that they held to circumcision and the
ceremonial law, were also said of the Cathari, and
of that branch of the Waldenses called Passaginians.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>
Is there any reasonable doubt that in
these ancient Christians we have the ancestors
of the Russian Sabbath-keepers of the fifteenth
century?</p>

<p>Mr. Maxson makes the following statement:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We find that Sabbath-keepers appear in Germany late
in the fifteenth or early in the sixteenth century according
to ‘Ross’s Picture of All Religions.’ By this we are to
understand that their numbers were such as to lead to
organization, and attract attention. A number of these
formed a church, and emigrated to America, in the early
settlement of this country.”<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Utter makes the following statement respecting
Sabbath-keepers in Germany and in
Holland:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Early in the sixteenth century there are traces of
Sabbath-keepers in Germany. The Old Dutch Martyrology
gives an account of a Baptist minister named<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
Stephen Benedict, somewhat famous for baptizing during
a severe persecution in Holland, who is supposed by good
authorities to have kept the seventh day as the Sabbath.
One of the persons baptized by him was Barbary von
Thiers, wife of Hans Borzen, who was executed on the
16th of September, 1529. At her trial she declared her
rejection of the idolatrous sacrament of the priest, and
also the Mass.”<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We give her declaration of faith respecting
Sundays and holy days:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“God has commanded us to rest on the seventh day.
Beyond this she did not go: but with the help and grace
of God she would persevere therein, and in death abide
thereby; for it is the true faith, and the right way in
Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another martyr, Christina Tolingerin, is mentioned
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Concerning holy days and Sundays, she said: ‘In
six days the Lord made the world, on the seventh day he
rested. The other holy days have been instituted by
popes, cardinals, and archbishops.’”<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There were at this time Sabbath-keepers in
France:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In France also there were Christians of this class,
among whom were M. de la Roque, who wrote in defense
of the Sabbath against Bossuet, Catholic bishop of
Meaux.”<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a></p>

</div>

<p>M. de la Roque is referred to by Dr. Wall in
his famous history of infant baptism “as a learned
man in other points,” but in great error for asserting
that “the primitive church did not baptize
infants.”<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> It is worthy of notice that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
Sabbath-keepers are always observers of scriptural
baptism—the burial of penitent believers in the
watery grave. No people retaining infant baptism,
or the sprinkling of believers, have observed
the seventh day.<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<p>The origin of the Sabbatarians of England cannot
now be definitely ascertained. Their observance
of believers’ baptism and the keeping of
the seventh day as the Sabbath of the Lord,
strongly attest their descent from the persecuted
heretics of the Dark Ages, rather than from the
reformers of the sixteenth century, who retained
infant baptism and the festival of Sunday. That
these heretics had long been numerous in England,
is thus certified by Crosby:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For in the time of William the Conqueror [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1070]
and his son William Rufus, it appears that the Waldenses
and their disciples out of France, Germany, and Holland,
had their frequent recourse, and did abound in England....
The Beringarian, or Waldensian heresy, as the
chronologer calls it, had, about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1080, generally corrupted
all France, Italy, and England.”<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Maxson says of the English Sabbatarians:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In England we find Sabbath-keepers very early. Dr.
Chambers says: ‘They arose in England in the sixteenth
century,’ from which we understand that they then became
a distinct denomination in that kingdom.”<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Benedict speaks thus of the origin of English
Sabbatarians:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“At what time the Seventh-day Baptists began to form
churches in this kingdom does not appear; but probably
it was at an early period; and although their churches
have never been numerous, yet there have been among
them almost for two hundred years past, some very eminent
men.”<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">HOW AND WHEN SUNDAY APPROPRIATED THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT.</span></h3>

<p>The light of the Reformation destroyed many of the best
Sunday arguments of the preceding Dark Ages—The controversy
between the Presbyterians and Episcopalians of
England brings Sunday sacredness to the test—The former
discover the means of enforcing the observance of Sunday
by the fourth commandment—How this can be done—Effects
of this extraordinary discovery—History of the Sunday
festival concluded.</p>

</div>

<p>The light of the Reformation necessarily dissipated
into thin air many of the most substantial
arguments by which the Sunday festival had been
built up during the Dark Ages. The roll that
fell from Heaven—the apparition of St. Peter—the
relief of souls in purgatory, and even of the
damned in hell—and many prodigies of fearful
portent—none of these, nor all of them combined,
were likely longer to sustain the sacredness of
the venerable day. True it was that when these
were swept away there remained to sustain the
festival of Sunday, the canons of councils, the
edicts of kings and emperors, the decrees of the
holy doctors of the church, and, greatest of all,
the imperious mandates of the Roman pontiff.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
Yet these could be adduced also in behalf of the
innumerable festivals ordained by the same great
apostate church. Such authority would answer
for the Episcopalian, who devoutly accepts of all
these festivals, because commanded so to do by
the church; but for those who acknowledge the
Bible as the only rule of faith, the case was different.
In the latter part of the sixteenth century,
the Presbyterians and Episcopalians of
England were involved in such a controversy as
brought this matter to an issue. The Episcopalians
required men to observe all the festivals of
the church; the Presbyterians observed Sunday,
and rejected all the rest. The Episcopalians
showed the inconsistency of this discrimination,
inasmuch as the same church authority had ordained
them all. As the Presbyterians rejected
the authority of the church, they would not keep
Sunday upon that ground, especially as it would
involve the observance also of all the other festivals.
They had to choose therefore between the
giving up of Sunday entirely, and the defense of
its observance by the Bible. There was indeed
another and a nobler choice that they might have
made, viz., to adopt the Sabbath of the Lord, but
it was too humiliating for them to unite with
those who retained that ancient and sacred institution.
The issue of this struggle is thus related
by a distinguished German theologian, Hengstenberg:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The opinion that the Sabbath was transferred to the
Sunday was first broached in its perfect form, and with
all its consequences, in the controversy which was carried
on in England between the Episcopalians and Presbyterians.
The Presbyterians, who carried to extremes the
principle, that every institution of the church must have
its foundation in the Scriptures, and would not allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
that God had given, in this respect, greater liberty to the
church of the New Testament, which his Spirit had
brought to maturity, than to that of the Old, charged
the Episcopalians with popish leaven, and superstition,
and subjection to the ordinances of men, because they
retained the Christian feasts. The Episcopalians, on the
other hand, as a proof that greater liberty was granted to
the New-Testament church in such matters as these, appealed
to the fact that even the observance of the Sunday
was only an arrangement of the church. The Presbyterians
were now in a position which compelled them
either to give up the observance of the Sunday, or to
maintain that a divine appointment from God separated
it from the other festivals. The first they could not do,
for their Christian experience was too deep for them not
to know how greatly the weakness of human nature
stands in need of regularly returning periods, devoted to
the service of God. They therefore decided upon the
latter.”<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus much for the occasion of that wonderful
discovery by which the Scriptures are made to
sustain the divine appointment of Sunday as the
Christian Sabbath. The date of the discovery,
the name of the discoverer, and the manner in
which he contrived to enforce the first day of the
week by the authority of the fourth commandment,
are thus set forth by a candid first-day historian,
Lyman Coleman:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The true doctrine of the Christian Sabbath was first
promulgated by an English dissenter, the Rev. Nicholas
Bound, D. D., of Norton, in the county of Suffolk.
About the year 1595, he published a famous book, entitled,
‘Sabbathum Veteris et Novi Testamenti,’ or the
True Doctrine of the Sabbath. In this book he maintained
‘that the seventh part of our time ought to be devoted
to God—that Christians are bound to rest on the
Lord’s day as much as the Jews were on the Mosaic Sabbath,
the commandment about rest being moral and perpetual;
and that it was not lawful for persons to follow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
their studies or worldly business on that day, nor to use
such pleasures and recreations as are permitted on other
days.’ This book spread with wonderful rapidity. The
doctrine which it propounded called forth from many
hearts a ready response, and the result was a most pleasing
reformation in many parts of the kingdom. ‘It is
almost incredible,’ says Fuller, ‘how taking this doctrine
was, partly because of its own purity, and partly for the
eminent piety of such persons as maintained it; so that
the Lord’s day, especially in corporations, began to be
precisely kept; people becoming a law unto themselves,
forbearing such sports as yet by statute permitted; yea,
many rejoicing at their own restraint herein.’ The law
of the Sabbath was indeed a religious principle, after
which the Christian church had, for centuries, been
darkly groping. Pious men of every age had felt the
necessity of divine authority for sanctifying the day.
Their conscience had been in advance of their reason.
Practically they had kept the Sabbath better than their
principles required.</p>

<p>“Public sentiment, however, was still unsettled in regard
to this new doctrine respecting the Sabbath, though
a few at first violently opposed it. ‘Learned men were
much divided in their judgments about these Sabbatarian
doctrines; some embraced them as ancient truths consonant
to Scripture, long disused and neglected, now seasonably
revived for the increase of piety. Others conceived
them grounded on a wrong bottom; but because
they tended to the manifest advance of religion, it was a
pity to oppose them; seeing none have just reason to
complain, being deceived unto their own good. But a
third sort flatly fell out with these propositions, as galling
men’s necks with a <i>Jewish yoke</i> against the liberty of
Christians; that Christ, as Lord of the Sabbath, had removed
the rigor thereof, and allowed men lawful recreations;
<i>that this doctrine put an unequal lustre on the Sunday</i>,
on set purpose to eclipse all other holy days, to the
derogation of the authority of the church; that this strict
observance was set up out of faction, to be a character
of difference to brand all for libertines who did not entertain
it.’ No open opposition, however, was at first manifested
against the sentiments of Dr. Bound. No reply
was attempted for several years, and ‘not so much as a
feather of a quill in print did wag against him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span></p>

<p>“His work was soon followed by several other treatises
in defense of the same sentiments. ‘All the Puritans
fell in with this doctrine, and distinguished themselves
by spending that part of sacred time in public, family,
and private devotion.’ Even Dr. Heylyn certified the
triumphant spread of those puritanical sentiments respecting
the Sabbath....</p>

<p>“‘This doctrine,’ he says, ‘carrying such a fair show
of piety, at least in the opinion of the common people,
and such as did not examine the true grounds of it, induced
many to embrace and defend it; and in a very
little time it became the most bewitching error and the
most popular infatuation that ever was embraced by the
people of England.’”<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Bound was not absolutely the inventor of
the seventh-part-of-time theory; but he may be
said rather to have gathered up and combined
the scattered hints of his predecessors, and to
have added to these something of his own production.
His grounds for asserting Sunday to
be the Sabbath of the fourth commandment are
these:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That which is natural, namely, that every seventh
day should be kept holy unto the Lord, that still remaineth:
that which is positive, namely, that day which
was the seventh day from the creation, should be the
Sabbath, or day of rest, that is now changed in the
church of God.”<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He says that the meaning of the declaration,
“The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God,” is this:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There must be one [day] of seven and not [one] of
eight.”<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span></p>

<p>But the special key to the whole theory is in
the statement that the seventh day in the commandment
was “<i>genus</i>,” that is to say, it was a
kind of seventh day which comprehended several
species of seventh days, at least two. Thus he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So he maketh the seventh day to be <i>genus</i> in this
commandment, and to be perpetual: and in it by virtue
of the commandment to comprehend these two species or
kinds: the Sabbath of the Jews and of the Gentiles, of
the law and of the gospel: so that both of them were
comprehended in the commandment, even as <i>genus</i> comprehendeth
both his species.”<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He enforces the first day by the fourth commandment,
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So that we have not in the gospel a new commandment
for the Sabbath, diverse from that that was in the
law; but there is a diverse time appointed; namely, not
the seventh day from the creation, but the day of Christ’s
resurrection, and the seventh from that: both of them at
several times being comprehended in the fourth commandment.”<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

</div>

<p>He means to say that the fourth commandment
enforces the seventh day from the creation
to the resurrection of Christ, and since that enforces
a different seventh day, namely, the seventh
from Christ’s resurrection. Such is the perverse
ingenuity by which men can evade the law
of God and yet make it appear that they are
faithfully observing it.</p>

<p>Such was the origin of the seventh-part-of-time
theory, by which the seventh day is dropped
out of the fourth commandment, and one day in
seven slipped into its place; a doctrine most opportunely
framed at the very period when nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
else could save the venerable day of the sun.
With the aid of this theory, the Sunday of “Pope
and Pagan” was able coolly to wrap itself in the
fourth commandment, and then in the character
of a divine institution, to challenge obedience
from all Bible Christians. It could now cast
away the other frauds on which its very existence
had depended, and support its authority by
this one alone. In the time of Constantine it
ascended the throne of the Roman Empire, and
during the whole period of the Dark Ages it
maintained its supremacy from the chair of St.
Peter; but now it had ascended the throne of
the Most High. And thus a day which God
“commanded not nor spake it, neither came it
into” his “mind,” was enjoined upon mankind
with all the authority of his holy law. The immediate
effect of Dr. Bound’s work upon the existing
controversy is thus described by an Episcopalian
eye-witness, Dr. Heylyn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For by inculcating to the people these new Sabbath
speculations [concerning Sunday], teaching that that day
only ‘was of God’s appointment, and all the rest observed
in the church of England, a remnant of the will-worship
in the church of Rome;’ the other holy days in
this church established, were so shrewdly shaken that till
this day they are not well recovered of the blow then
given. Nor came this on the by or besides their purpose,
but as a thing that specially was intended from the first
beginning.”<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In a former chapter, we called attention to the
fact that Sunday can be maintained as a divine
institution only by adopting the rule of faith acknowledged
in the church of Rome, which is, the
Bible with the traditions of the church added
thereto. We have seen that in the sixteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
the Presbyterians of England were brought
to decide between giving up Sunday as a church
festival and maintaining it as a divine institution
by the Bible. They chose the latter course. Yet
while apparently avoiding the charge of observing
a Catholic festival, by claiming to prove the Sunday
institution out of the Bible, the utterly unsatisfactory
nature of the several inferences adduced
from the Scriptures in support of that day, compelled
them to resort to the traditions of the
church, and to add these to their so-called biblical
evidences in its behalf. It would be no
worse to keep Sunday while frankly acknowledging
it to be a festival of the Catholic church,
not commanded in the Bible, than it is to profess
that you observe it as a biblical institution, and
then prove it to be such by adopting the rule
of faith of the Romanists. Joaunes Perrone,
an eminent Italian Catholic theologian, in an
important doctrinal work, entitled, “Theological
Lessons,” makes a very impressive statement
respecting the acknowledgment of tradition by
Protestant Sunday-keepers. In his chapter “Concerning
the Necessity and Existence of Tradition,”
he lays down the proposition that it is necessary
to admit doctrines which we can prove
only from tradition, and cannot sustain from the
Holy Scriptures. Then he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not possible, indeed, if traditions of such character
are rejected, that several doctrines, which the Protestants
held with us since they withdrew from the Catholic
church, could, in any possible manner, be established.
The fact is placed beyond a venture of a doubt, for
they themselves hold with us the validity of baptism administered
by heretics or infidels, the validity also of
infant baptism, the true form of baptism [sprinkling];
they held, too, that the law of abstaining from blood and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
anything strangled is not in force; also concerning the
substitution of the Lord’s day for the Sabbath; besides
those things which I have mentioned before, and not a
few others.”<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Bound’s theory of the seventh part of time
has found general acceptance in all those churches
which sprung from the church of Rome. Most
forcibly did old Cotton Mather observe:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The reforming churches, flying from Rome, carried,
some of them more, some of them less, all of them something,
of Rome with them.”<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a></p>

</div>

<p>One sacred treasure which they all drew from
the venerable mother of harlots is the ancient
festival of the sun. She had crushed out of her
communion the Sabbath of the Lord, and having
adopted the venerable day of the sun, had transformed
it into the Lord’s day of the Christian
church. The reformed, flying from her communion,
and carrying with them this ancient festival,
now found themselves able to justify its observance
as being indeed the veritable Sabbath of the
Lord! As the seamless coat of Jesus, the Lord
of the Sabbath, was torn from him before he was
nailed to the cross, so has the fourth commandment
been torn from the rest-day of the Lord,
around which it was placed by the great Law-giver,
and given to this papal Lord’s day; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
this Barabbas the robber, thus arrayed in the
stolen fourth commandment, has from that time
to the present day, and with astonishing success,
challenged the obedience of the world as the divinely
appointed Sabbath of the most high God.
Here we close the history of the Sunday festival,
now fully transformed into the <i>Christian Sabbath</i>.
A rapid survey of the history of English and
American Sabbath-keepers will conclude this
work.</p>

</div>

<p>Chambers speaks thus of Sabbath-keepers in
the sixteenth century:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the reign of Elizabeth, it occurred to many conscientious
and independent thinkers (as it had previously
done to some Protestants in Bohemia), that the fourth commandment
required of them the observance, not of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
first, but of the specified <i>seventh</i> day of the week, and a
strict bodily rest, as a service then due to God; while
others, though convinced that the day had been altered
by divine authority, took up the same opinion as to the
scriptural obligation to refrain from work. The former
class became numerous enough to make a considerable
figure for more than a century in England, under the
title of ‘Sabbatarians’—a word now exchanged for the
less ambiguous appellation of ‘Seventh-day Baptists.’”<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Gilfillan quotes an English writer of the year
1584, John Stockwood, who says that there were
then</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A great diversity of opinion among the vulgar people
and simple sort, concerning the Sabbath day, and the
right use of the same.”</p>

</div>

<p>And Gilfillan states one of the grounds of controversy
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some maintaining the unchanged and unchangeable
obligation of the seventh-day Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In 1607, an English first-day writer, John
Sprint, gave the views of the Sabbath-keepers of
that time, which in truth have been substantially
the same in all ages:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They allege reasons drawn, 1. From the precedence
of the Sabbath before the law, and before the fall; the
laws of which nature are immutable. 2. From the perpetuity
of the moral law. 3. And from the large extent
thereof appertaining to [the Sabbath above] all [the other
precepts.] 4. ... And of the cause of [this precept of]
the law which maketh it perpetual, which is the memorial
and meditation of the works of God; which belong unto
the Christians as well as to the Jews.”<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></p>

</div>

<p>John Trask began to speak and write in favor
of the seventh day as the Sabbath of the Lord,
about the time that King James I., and the archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
of Canterbury, published the famous
“Book of Sports for Sunday,” in 1618. His field
of labor was London, and being a very zealous
man, he was soon called to account by the persecuting
authority of the church of England. He
took high ground as to the sufficiency of the
Scriptures to direct in all religious services, and
that the civil authorities ought not to constrain
men’s consciences in matters of religion. He was
brought before the infamous Star Chamber, where
a long discussion was held respecting the Sabbath.
It was on this occasion that Bishop Andrews
first brought forward that now famous first-day
argument, that the early martyrs were tested by
the question, “Hast thou kept the Lord’s day?”<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></p>

<p>Gilfillan, quoting the words of cotemporary
writers, says of Trask’s trial that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For ‘making of conventicles and factions, by that
means which may tend to sedition and commotion, and
for scandalizing the king, the bishops, and the clergy,’
‘he was censured in the Star Chamber to be set upon the
pillory at Westminster, and from thence to be whipt to
the fleet, there to remain a prisoner.’”<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This cruel sentence was carried into execution,
and finally broke his spirit. After enduring the
misery of his prison for one year, he recanted his
doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> The case of his wife is worthy of particular
mention. Pagitt gives her character thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“She was a woman endued with many particular virtues,
well worthy the imitation of all good Christians,
had not error in other things, especially a spirit of strange
unparalleled opinionativeness and obstinacy in her private
conceits, spoiled her.”<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Pagitt says that she was a school teacher of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
superior excellence. She was particularly careful
in her dealings with the poor. He gives her
reasons thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This she professed to do out of conscience, as believing
she must one day come to be judged for all things
done in the flesh. Therefore she resolved to go by <i>the
safest rule</i>, rather against than for her private interest.”<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Pagitt gives her crime in the following words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At last for teaching only five days in the week, and
resting upon Saturday, <i>it being known upon what account
she did it</i>, she was carried to the new prison in Maiden
Lane, a place then appointed for the restraint of several
other persons of different opinions from the church of
England.”<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Observe the crime: it was not what she did,
for a first-day person might have done the same,
but because she did it to obey the fourth commandment.
Her motive exposed her to the
vengeance of the authorities. She was a woman
of indomitable courage, and would not purchase
her liberty by renouncing the Lord’s Sabbath.
During her long imprisonment, Pagitt says that
some one wrote her thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your constant suffering would be praiseworthy, were
it for truth; but being for error, your recantation will be
both more acceptable to God, and laudable before men.”<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But her faith and patience held out till she
was released by death.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mrs. Trask lay fifteen or sixteen years a prisoner for
her opinion about the Saturday Sabbath; in all which
time she would receive no relief from anybody, notwithstanding
she wanted much: alleging that it was written,
‘It is more blessed ... to give than to receive.’ Neither
would she borrow, because it was written, ‘Thou
shalt lend to many nations, and shalt not borrow.’ So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
she deemed it a dishonor to her head, Christ, either to
beg or borrow. Her diet for the most part during her
imprisonment, that is, till a little before her death, was
bread and water, roots and herbs; no flesh, nor wine, nor
brewed drink. All her means was an annuity of forty
shillings a year; what she lacked more to live upon she
had of such prisoners as did employ her sometimes to do
business for them.”<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Pagitt, who was the cotemporary of Trask,
thus states the principles of the Sabbatarians of
that time, whom he calls Traskites:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The positions concerning the Sabbath by them maintained
were these:—</p>

<p>“1. That the fourth commandment of the Decalogue,
‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy’ [Ex. 20], is
a divine precept, simply and entirely moral, containing
nothing legally ceremonial in whole or in part, and therefore
the weekly observation thereof ought to be perpetual,
and to continue in force and virtue to the world’s end.</p>

<p>“2. That the Saturday, or seventh day in every week,
ought to be an everlasting holy day in the Christian
church, and the religious observation of this day obligeth
Christians under the gospel, as it did the Jews before the
coming of Christ.</p>

<p>“3. That the Sunday, or Lord’s day, is an ordinary
working day, and it is superstition and will-worship to
make the same the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.”<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was for this noble confession of faith that
Mrs. Trask was shut up in prison till the day of
her death. For the same, Mr. Trask was compelled
to stand in the pillory, and was whipped
from thence to the fleet, and then shut up in a
wretched prison, from which he escaped by recantation
after enduring its miseries for more
than a year.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Utter mentions the next Sabbatarian minister
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Theophilus Brabourne, a learned minister of the gospel
in the established church, wrote a book, which was
printed at London in 1628, wherein he argued ‘that the
Lord’s day is not the Sabbath day by divine institution,’
but ‘that the seventh-day Sabbath is now in force.’ Mr.
Brabourne published another book in 1632, entitled, ‘A
Defense of that most Ancient and Sacred Ordinance of
God’s, the Sabbath Day.’”<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Brabourne dedicated his book to King Charles
I., requesting him to use his royal authority for
the restoration of the ancient Sabbath. But
those who put their trust in princes are sure to
be disappointed. Dr. F. White, bishop of Ely,
thus states the occasion of his own work against
the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now because this Brabourne’s treatise of the Sabbath
was dedicated to his Royal Majesty, and the principles
upon which he grounded all his arguments (being
commonly preached, printed, and believed throughout
the kingdom), might have poisoned and infected many
people either with this Sabbatarian error, or with some
other of like quality; it was the king, our gracious master,
his will and pleasure, that a treatise should be set
forth, to prevent further mischief, and to settle his good
subjects (who have long time been distracted about Sabbatarian
questions) in the old and good way of the ancient
and orthodoxal Catholic church. Now that which
his sacred Majesty commanded, I have by your Grace’s
direction [Archbishop Laud] obediently performed.”<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The king not only wished by this appointment
to overthrow those who kept the day enjoined
in the commandment, but also those who by
means of Dr. Bound’s new theory pretended that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
Sunday was that day. He therefore joined Dr.
Heylyn with Bishop White in this work:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Which burden being held of too great weight for any
one to undergo, and the necessity of the work requiring
a quick dispatch, it was held fit to divide the employment
betwixt two. The argumentative and scholastical part
was referred to the right learned Dr. White, then bishop
of Ely, who had given good proof of his ability in polemical
matters in several books and disputations against the
papists. The practical and historical [was to be written],
by Heylyn of Westminster, who had gained some reputation
for his studies in the ancient writers.”<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The works of White and Heylyn were published
simultaneously in 1635. Dr. White, in
addressing himself to those who enforce Sunday
observance by the fourth commandment, speaks
thus of Brabourne’s arguments, that not Sunday,
but the ancient seventh day, is there enjoined:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Maintaining your own principles that the fourth commandment
is purely and simply moral and of the law of
nature, it will be impossible for you either in English or
in Latin, to solve Theophilus Brabourne’s objections.”<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But the king had something besides argument
for Brabourne. He was brought before Archbishop
Laud and the court of High Commission,
and, moved by the fate of Mrs. Trask, he submitted
for the time to the authority of the church
of England, but sometime afterward wrote other
books in behalf of the seventh day.<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> Dr. White’s
book has this pithy notice of the indefinite-time
theory:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Because an indefinite time must either bind to all
moments of time, as a debt, when the day of payment is
not expressly dated, is liable to payment every moment;
or else it binds to no time at all.”<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Utter, after the statement of Brabourne’s
case, continues thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“About this time Philip Tandy began to promulgate
in the northern part of England the same doctrine concerning
the Sabbath. He was educated in the established
church, of which he became a minister. Having changed
his views respecting the mode of baptism and the day of
the Sabbath, he abandoned that church and ‘became a
mark for many shots.’ He held several public disputes
about his peculiar sentiments, and did much to propagate
them. James Ockford was another early advocate in
England of the claims of the seventh day as the Sabbath.
He appears to have been well acquainted with the discussions
in which Trask and Brabourne had been engaged.
Being dissatisfied with the pretended conviction of Brabourne,
he wrote a book in defense of Sabbatarian views,
entitled, ‘The Doctrine of the Fourth Commandment.’
This book, published about the year 1642, was burnt by
order of the authorities in the established church.”<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The famous Stennett family furnished, for four
generations, a succession of able Sabbatarian
ministers. Mr. Edward Stennett, the first of
these, was born about the beginning of the seventeenth
century. His work entitled, “The Royal
Law Contended For,” was first published at
London in 1658. “He was an able and devoted
minister, but dissenting from the established
church, he was deprived of the means of support.”
“He suffered much of the persecution
which the Dissenters were exposed to at that
time, and more especially for his faithful adherence
to the cause of the Sabbath. For this truth
he experienced tribulation, not only from those in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
power, by whom he was kept a long time in prison,
but also much distress from unfriendly, dissenting
brethren, who strove to destroy his influence, and
ruin his cause.” In 1664, he published a work
entitled, “The Seventh Day is the Sabbath of
the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> In 1671, Wm. Sellers wrote a work
in behalf of the seventh day in reply to Dr.
Owen. Cox states its object thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In opposition to the opinion <i>that some one day in
seven</i> is all that the fourth commandment requires to be
set apart, the writer maintains the obligation of the Saturday
Sabbath on the ground that ‘God himself directly
in the letter of the text calls the seventh day the Sabbath
day, giving both the names to one and the selfsame
day, as all men know that ever read the commandments.’”<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

</div>

<p>One of the most eminent Sabbatarian ministers
of the last half of the seventeenth century was
Francis Bampfield. He was originally a clergyman
of the church of England. The Baptist
historian, Crosby, speaks of him thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But being utterly unsatisfied in his conscience with
the conditions of conformity, he took his leave of his
sorrowful and weeping congregation in ... 1662, and
was quickly after imprisoned for worshiping God in his
own family. So soon was his unshaken loyalty to the
king forgotten, ... that he was more frequently imprisoned
and exposed to greater hardships for his nonconformity,
than most other dissenters.”<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of his imprisonment, Neale says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After the act of uniformity, he continued preaching
as he had opportunity in private, till he was imprisoned
for five days and nights, with twenty-five of his hearers
in one room ... where they spent their time in religious
exercises, but after some time he was released.
Soon after, he was apprehended again and lay nine years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
in Dorchester jail, though he was a person of unshaken
loyalty to the king.”<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a></p>

</div>

<p>During his imprisonment, he preached almost
every day, and gathered a church even under his
confinement. And when he was at liberty, he
ceased not to preach in the name of Jesus. After
his release, he went to London, where he preached
with much success.<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> Neale says of his labors in
that city:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When he resided in London he formed a church on
the principles of the Sabbatarian Baptists, at Pinner’s
hall, of which principles he was a zealous asserter. He
was a celebrated preacher, and a man of serious piety.”<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On Feb. 17, 1682, he was arrested while preaching,
and on March 28, was sentenced to forfeit all
his goods and to be imprisoned in Newgate for
life. In consequence of the hardships which he
suffered in that prison, he died, Feb. 16, 1683.<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>
“Bampfield,” says Wood, “dying in the said prison
of Newgate ... aged seventy years, his
body was ... followed with a very great
company of factious and schismatical people to
his grave.”<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> Crosby says of him:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All that knew him will acknowledge that he was a
man of great piety. And he would in all probability
have preserved the same character, with respect to his
learning and judgment, had it not been for his opinion
in two points, viz., that infants ought not to be baptized,
and that the Jewish Sabbath ought still to be kept.”<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Bampfield published two works in behalf
of the seventh day as the Sabbath, one in 1672,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
the other in 1677. In the first of these he thus
sets forth the doctrine of the Sabbath:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The law of the seventh-day Sabbath was given before
the law was proclaimed at Sinai, even from the creation,
given to Adam, ... and in him to all the
world.<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>... The Lord Christ’s obedience unto this
<i>fourth word</i> in observing in his lifetime the seventh day
as a weekly Sabbath day, ... and no other day of
the week as such, is a part of that perfect righteousness
which every sound believer doth apply to himself in order
to his being justified in the sight of God; and every
such person is to conform unto Christ in all the acts of
his obedience to the ten words.”<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

</div>

<p>His brother, Mr. Thomas Bampfield, who had
been speaker in one of Cromwell’s parliaments,
wrote also in behalf of seventh-day observance,
and was imprisoned for his religious principles
in Ilchester jail.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> About the time of Mr. Bampfield’s
first imprisonment, severe persecution arose
against the Sabbath-keepers in London. Crosby
thus bears testimony:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was about this time [<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1661], that a congregation
of Baptists holding the seventh day as a Sabbath,
being assembled at their meeting-house in Bull-stake alley,
the doors being open, about three o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> [Oct.
19], whilst Mr. John James was preaching, one Justice
Chard, with Mr. Wood, an headborough, came into the
meeting-place. Wood commanded him in the king’s name
to be silent and come down, having spoken treason
against the king. But Mr. James, taking little or no
notice thereof, proceeded in his work. The headborough
came nearer to him in the middle of the meeting-place
and commanded him again in the king’s name to come
down or else he would pull him down; whereupon the
disturbance grew so great that he could not proceed.”<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span></p>

<p>The officer having pulled him down from the
pulpit, led him away to the court under a strong
guard. Mr. Utter continues this narrative as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. James was himself examined and committed to
Newgate, on the testimony of several profligate witnesses,
who accused him of speaking treasonable words
against the king. His trial took place about a month
afterward, at which he conducted himself in such a manner
as to create much sympathy. He was, however, sentenced
to be hanged, drawn and quartered.<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> This awful
sentence did not dismay him in the least. He calmly
said, ‘Blessed be God; whom man condemneth, God
justifieth.’ While he lay in prison, under sentence of
death, many persons of distinction visited him, who were
greatly affected by his piety and resignation, and offered
to exert themselves to secure his pardon. But he seems
to have had little hope of their success. Mrs. James, by
advice of her friends, twice presented petitions to the
king [Charles II.], setting forth the innocence of her
husband, the character of the witnesses against him, and
entreating His Majesty to grant a pardon. In both instances
she was repulsed with scoffs and ridicule. At the
scaffold, on the day of his execution, Mr. James addressed
the assembly in a very noble and affecting manner.
Having finished his address, and kneeling down, he
thanked God for covenant mercies, and for conscious
innocence; he prayed for the witnesses against him, for
the executioner, for the people of God, for the removal
of divisions, for the coming of Christ, for the spectators,
and for himself, that he might enjoy a sense of God’s favor
and presence, and an entrance into glory. When he
had ended, the executioner said, ‘The Lord receive your
soul;’ to which Mr. James replied, ‘I thank thee.’ A
friend observing to him, ‘This is a happy day,’ he answered,
‘I bless God it is.’ Then having thanked the
sheriff for his courtesy, he said, ‘Father, into thy hands
I commit my spirit.’... After he was dead his
heart was taken out and burned, his quarters were affixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
to the gates of the city, and his head was set up in
White chapel on a pole opposite to the alley in which his
meeting-house stood.”<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was the experience of English Sabbath-keepers
in the seventeenth century. It cost something
to obey the fourth commandment in such
times as those. The laws of England during that
century were very oppressive to all Dissenters,
and bore exceedingly hard upon the Sabbath-keepers.
But God raised up able men, eminent
for piety, to defend his truth during those troublous
times, and, if need be, to seal their testimony
with their blood. In the seventeenth century,
eleven churches of Sabbatarians flourished in
England, while many scattered Sabbath-keepers
were to be found in various parts of that kingdom.
Now, but three of these churches are in
existence! And only remnants, even of these,
remain!</p>

<p>To what cause shall we assign this painful
fact? It is not because their adversaries were
able to confute their doctrine; for the controversial
works on both sides still remain, and
speak for themselves. It is not that they lacked
men of piety and of learning; for God gave
them these, especially in the seventeenth century.
Nor is it that fanaticism sprang up and
disgraced the cause; for there is no record of
anything of this kind. They were cruelly persecuted,
but the period of their persecution was
that of their greatest prosperity. Like Moses’
bush, they stood unconsumed in the burning fire.
The prostration of the Sabbath cause in England
is due to none of these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span></p>

<p>The Sabbath was wounded in the house of its
own friends. They took upon themselves the
responsibility, after a time, of making the Sabbath
of no practical importance, and of treating its
violation as no very serious transgression of the
law of God. Doubtless they hoped to win men
to Christ and his truth by this course; but, instead
of this, they simply lowered the standard
of divine truth into the dust. The Sabbath-keeping
ministers assumed the pastoral care of
first-day churches, in some cases as their sole
charge, in others, they did this in connection
with the oversight of Sabbatarian churches.
The result need surprise no one; as these Sabbath-keeping
ministers and churches said to all
men, in thus acting, that the fourth commandment
might be broken with impunity, the people
took them at their word. Mr. Crosby, a
first-day historian, sets this matter in a clear
light:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the seventh day ought to be observed as the Christian
Sabbath, then all congregations that observe the first
day as such must be Sabbath-breakers.... I must
leave those gentlemen on the contrary side to their own
sentiments; and to vindicate the practice of becoming
pastors to a people whom in their conscience they must
believe to be breakers of the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Doubtless there have been noble exceptions to
this course; but the body of English Sabbatarians
for many years have failed to faithfully
discharge the high trust committed to them.</p>

</div>

<p>The first Sabbatarian church in America originated
at Newport, R. I. The first Sabbath-keeper
in America was Stephen Mumford, who
left London three years after the martyrdom of
John James, and forty-four years after the landing
of the pilgrim fathers at Plymouth. Mr.
Mumford, it appears, came as a missionary from
the English Sabbath-keepers.<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> Mr. Isaac Backus,
the historian of the early New England Baptists,
makes the following record:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Stephen Mumford came over from London in 1664,
and brought the opinion with him that the whole of the
ten commandments, as they were delivered from Mount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
Sinai, were moral and immutable; and that it was the
Antichristian power which thought to change times and
laws, that changed the Sabbath from the seventh to the
first day of the week. Several members of the first
church in Newport embraced this sentiment, and yet
continued with the church for some years, until two men
and their wives who had so done, turned back to the
keeping of the first day again.”<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Mumford, on his arrival, went earnestly to
work to convert men to the observance of the
fourth commandment, as we infer from the following
record:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Stephen Mumford, the first Sabbath-keeper in America,
came from London in 1664. Tacy Hubbard commenced
keeping the Sabbath, March 11, 1665. Samuel
Hubbard commenced April 1, 1665. Rachel Langworthy,
January 15, 1666. Roger Baxter, April 15, 1666, and
William Hiscox, April 28, 1666. These were the first Sabbath-keepers
in America. A controversy, lasting several
years, sprung up between them and members of the
church. They desired to retain their connection with
the church, but were, at last, compelled to withdraw,
that they might peaceably enjoy and keep God’s holy
day.”<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> [Baxter is Baster in the <i>S. D. B. Memorial</i>.]</p>

</div>

<p>Though Mr. Mumford faithfully taught the
truth, he seems to have cherished the ideas of
the English Sabbatarians, that it was possible for
first-day and seventh-day observers to walk together
in church fellowship. Had the first-day
people been of the same mind, the light of the
Sabbath would have been extinguished within a
few years, as the history of English Sabbath-keepers
clearly proves. But, in the providence
of God, the danger was averted by the opposition
which these commandment-keepers had to encounter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span></p>

<p>Besides the persons above enumerated, four
others embraced the Sabbath in 1666, but in
1668 they renounced it. These four were also
members of the first-day Baptist church of Newport.
Though the Sabbath-keepers who retained
their integrity thought that they might lawfully
commune with the members of the church who
were fully persuaded to observe the first day, yet
they felt otherwise with respect to these who
had clearly seen the Sabbath, and had for a time
observed it, and then apostatized from it. These
persons “both wrote and spoke against it, which
so grieved them that they could not sit down at
the table of the Lord with them, nor with the
church because of them.” But as they were
members of a first-day church, and had “no
power to deal with them as of themselves without
the help of the church,” they “found themselves
barred as to proceeding with them, as being
but private brethren. So they concluded
not to bring the case to the church to judge of
the fact, viz., in turning from the observation of
the seventh day, being contrary-minded as to
that.” They therefore sent to the London Sabbath-keepers
for advice, and in the mean time
refrained from communing with the church.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward Stennet wrote them in behalf of
the London Sabbath-keepers: “If the church
will hold communion with these apostates from
the truth, you ought then to desire to be fairly
dismissed from the church; which if the church
refuse, you ought to withdraw yourselves.”<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> They
decided, however, not to leave the church. But
they told “the church publicly that they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
not have comfortable communion with those four
persons that had sinned.” “And thus for several
months they walked with little or no offense from
the church; after which the leading or ministering
brethren began to declare themselves concerning
the ten precepts.” Mr. Tory “declared the
law to be done away.” Mr. Luker and Mr. Clarke
“made it their work to preach the non-observation
of the law, day after day.” But the Sabbath-keepers
replied “that the ten precepts were
still as holy, just, good, and spiritual, as ever.”
Mr. Tory “with some unpleasant words said ‘that
their tune was only the fourth precept,’ to which
they answered, ‘that the whole ten precepts were
of equal force with them, and that they did not
plead for one without the other.’ And they for
several years, went on with the church in a halvish
kind of fellowship.”<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Bailey thus states the result:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At the time of their change of sentiment and practice,
[respecting the Bible Sabbath], they had no intention of
establishing a church with this distinctive feature. God,
evidently, had a different mission for them, and brought
them to it, through the severe trial of persecution. They
were forced to leave the fellowship of the Baptist church,
or abandon the Sabbath of the Lord their God.”<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a></p>

<p>“These left the Baptist church on December 7, 1671.”<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

<p>“On the 23d of December, just sixteen days after withdrawing
from the Baptist church, they covenanted together
in a church organization.”<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was the origin of the first Sabbath-keeping
church in America.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> The second of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
churches owes its origin to this circumstance:
About the year 1700, Edmund Dunham of Piscataway,
N. J., reproved a person for labor on Sunday.
He was asked for his authority from the
Scriptures. On searching for this, he became satisfied
that the seventh day is the only weekly
Sabbath in the Bible, and began to observe it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Soon after, others followed his example, and in 1707
a Seventh-day Baptist church was organized, with seventeen
members. Edmund Dunham was chosen pastor and
sent to Rhode Island to receive ordination.”<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The S. D. Baptist General Conference was organized
in 1802. At its first annual session, it
included in its organization eight churches, nine
ordained ministers, and 1130 members.<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> The
Conference was organized with only advisory powers,
the individual churches retaining the matters
of discipline and church government in their own
hands.<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> The Conference now embraces some
eighty churches, and about 8000 members. These
churches are found in most of the northern and
western States, and are divided into five associations,
which, however, have no legislative nor disciplinary
power over the churches which compose
them. There are, belonging to the denomination,
five academies, one college, “and a university
with academic, collegiate, mechanical, and theological
departments in operation.”<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> The S. D.
Baptist missionary society sustains several home
missionaries who labor principally on the western
and southern borders of the denomination. They
have within a few years past met with a good
degree of success in this work. It has also a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
missionary station at Shanghai, China, and a
small church there of faithful Christians.</p>

<p>The American Sabbath Tract Society is the
publishing agency of the denomination. Its head-quarters
are at Alfred Center, N. Y. It publishes
the <i>Sabbath Recorder</i>, the organ of the S. D. Baptists,
and it also publishes a series of valuable
works relating to the Sabbath and the law of
God.</p>

<p>During the two hundred years which have
elapsed since the organization of the first Sabbatarian
church in America, God has raised up
among this people men of eminent talent and
moral worth. He has also in providential ways
called attention to the sacred trust which he so
long since confided to the S. D. Baptists, and
which they have been slow to realize in its immense
importance.</p>

<p>Among those converted to the Sabbath through
the agency of this people, the name of J. W.
Morton is particularly worthy of honorable mention.
He was sent in 1847 a missionary to the
island of Hayti by the Reformed Presbyterians.
Here he came in contact with Sabbatarian publications,
and after a serious examination became
satisfied that the seventh day is the Sabbath of
the Lord. As an honest man, what he saw to
be truth he immediately obeyed, and returning
home to be tried for his heresy, was summarily
expelled from the Reformed Presbyterian church
without being suffered to state the reasons which
had governed his conduct. He has given to the
world a valuable work, entitled, “Vindication of
the True Sabbath,” in which his experience is related,
and his reasons for observing the seventh
day set forth with great force and clearness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span></p>

<p>The S. D. Baptists do not lack men of education
and of talent, and they have ample means in
their possession with which to sustain the cause
of God. If in time past they have not fully realized
that they were debtors to all mankind because
of the great truth which God committed to
their trust, there is reason to believe that they
are now to some extent awakening to this vast
indebtedness.<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a></p>

<p>There is also in the State of Pennsylvania a
small body of German S. D. Baptists found in the
counties of Lancaster, York, Franklin, and Bedford,
and in the central and western parts of the
State. They originated in 1728 from the teaching
of Conrad Beissel, a native of Germany.
They practice trine immersion, and the washing
of feet, and observe open communion. They encourage
celibacy, but make it obligatory upon
none. Even those who have chosen this manner
of life are at liberty to marry if at any time they
choose so to do. They established and successfully
maintained a Sabbath-school at Ephrata,
their head-quarters, forty years before Robert
Raikes had introduced the system of Sunday-schools.
This people have suffered much persecution
because of their observance of the seventh
day, the laws of Pennsylvania being particularly
oppressive toward Sabbatarians.<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> The German
S. D. Baptists do not belong to the S. D. Baptist
General Conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span></p>

<p>We have already noticed the fact that Sabbath-keepers
are numerous in Russia, in Poland, and
in Turkey. We find the following statement respecting
Sabbath-keepers in Hungary:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A congregation of seventh-day Christians in Hungary,
being refused tolerance by the laws, has embraced Judaism,
in order to be allowed to exist in connection with
one of the ‘received religions.’”<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The probability is that as the laws of the Austrian
Empire bear very heavily upon all religious
bodies not belonging to some one of the tolerated
sects or orders, these “Seventh-day Christians”
on “being refused tolerance” in their own name,
secured the privilege of observing the seventh
day by allowing their doctrine to be classed by
the civil authorities under the head of Judaism,
and so bringing themselves under the tolerance
accorded to the “received religions.” We do not
say that this was right, even as a technicality,
but it is evidently the extent of what they did.
There is no reason to believe that they abjured
Christ. We also learn that there are Sabbath-keepers
in the north of Asia:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is a sect of Greek Christians in Siberia who
keep the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday). Such sects already
exist in the United States, in Germany, and we believe in
England.”<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Sabbath was first introduced to the attention
of the Advent people at Washington, N. H.
A faithful Seventh-day Baptist sister, Mrs. Rachel
D. Preston, from the State of New York,
having removed to this place, brought with her
the Sabbath of the Lord. Here she became interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span>
in the doctrine of the glorious advent of
the Saviour at hand. Being instructed in this
subject by the Advent people, she in turn instructed
them in the commandments of God, and
as early as 1844, nearly the entire church in that
place, consisting of about forty persons, became
observers of the Sabbath of the Lord.<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> The oldest
body of Sabbath-keepers among the Seventh-day
Adventists is therefore at Washington, N. H.
Its present number is small, for it has been thinned
by emigration and by the ravages of death; but
there still remains a small company to bear witness
to this ancient truth of the Bible.</p>

<p>From this place, several Advent ministers received
the Sabbath truth during the year 1844.
One of these was Eld. T. M. Preble, who has the
honor of first bringing this great truth before
the Adventists through the medium of the press.
His essay was dated Feb. 13, 1845. He presented
briefly the claims of the Bible Sabbath,
and showed that it was not changed by the Saviour,
but was changed by the great apostasy.
He then said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus we see Dan. 7:25, fulfilled, the little horn
changing ‘times and laws.’ Therefore it appears to me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[502]</span>
that all who keep the first day for the Sabbath, are Pope’s
Sunday-keepers, and God’s Sabbath breakers.”<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Within a few months many persons began to
observe the Sabbath as the result of the light
thus shed on their pathway. Eld. J. B. Cook,
a man of decided talent as a preacher and a
writer, was one of these early converts to the
Sabbath. Elders Preble and Cook were at this
time in the full vigor of their mental powers,
and were possessed of talent and a reputation for
piety, which gave them great influence among
the Adventists in behalf of the Sabbath. These
men were called in the providence of God to fill
an important place in the work of Sabbath reform.</p>

<p>But both of them, while preaching and writing
in its behalf, committed the fatal error of making
it of no practical importance. They had apparently
the same fellowship for those who rejected the
Sabbath that they had for those who observed it.
Such a course of action produced its natural result.
After two or three years of this kind of
Sabbath observance, each of these men apostatized
from it, and thenceforward used what influence
they possessed in warring against the
fourth commandment. The larger part of those
who embraced the Sabbath from their labors
were not sufficiently impressed with its importance
to become settled and grounded in its
weighty evidences, and, after a brief period,
they turned back from its observance. But
enough had been done to excite bitter opposition
toward the Sabbath on the part of many Adventists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>
and to bring out the ingenious and
plausible arguments by which men attempt to
prove that God has abolished his own sacred law.</p>

<p>Such was the fruit of their course, and such
the condition of things at the time of their defection.
But the result of their plan of action
taught the Advent Sabbath-keepers a lesson of
value, which they have never forgotten. They
learned that the fourth commandment must be
treated as a part of the moral law, if men are
ever to be led to its sacred observance.</p>

<p>Eld. Preble’s first article in behalf of the Sabbath
was the means of calling the attention of
our venerable brother, Joseph Bates, to this divine
institution. He soon became convinced of
its obligation, and at once began to observe it.
He had acted quite a prominent part in the Advent
movement of 1843-4, and now, with self-sacrificing
zeal, he took hold of the despised Sabbath
truth to set it before his fellow-men. He
did not do it in the half-way manner of Elders
Preble and Cook, but as a man thoroughly in
earnest and fully alive to the importance of his
subject.</p>

<p>The subject of the heavenly Sanctuary began
about this time to interest many Adventists, and
especially Eld. Bates. He was one of the first to
see that the central object of that Sanctuary is
the ark of God. He also called attention to the
proclamation of the third angel relative to God’s
commandments. He girded on the armor to lay
it down only when his work should be accomplished.
He has been instrumental in leading
many to the observance of the commandments of
God and the faith of Jesus, and few who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span>
received the Sabbath from his teaching have
apostatized from it.<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p>It was but a few months after Eld. Bates, that
our esteemed and efficient brother, Eld. James
White, also embraced the Sabbath. He had labored
with much success in the great Advent
movement, and he now entered heartily into the
work of Sabbath reform. Uniting with Eld.
Bates in the proclamation of the doctrine of the
advent and the Sabbath as connected together
in the Sanctuary and the message of the third
angel, he has, with the blessing of God, accomplished
great results in behalf of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>The publishing interests of the Seventh-day
Adventists originated through his instrumentality.
He began the work of publishing in
1849, without resources, and with very few
friends, but with much toil, self-sacrifice, and
anxious care; and with the blessing of God upon
his efforts, he has been the means of establishing
an efficient office of publication, and of disseminating
many important works throughout our
country, and, to some extent, to other nations
also. The publication of the <i>Advent Review
and Herald of the Sabbath</i>, the organ of the
Seventh-day Adventists, was commenced by him
in 1850. For most of the years of its existence,
he has served as one of its editors; and for all
its earlier years, he was both publisher and sole
editor. During this time, he has also labored
with energy as a minister of the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>The wants of the cause demanding an enlargement
of capital and more extensive operations,
to this end an Association was incorporated in
the city of Battle Creek, Michigan, May 3, 1861,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span>
under the name of the Seventh-day Adventist
Publishing Association. This Association owns
three commodious publishing houses, with engine,
power presses, and all the fixtures necessary for
doing an extensive business. There are about
fifty persons constantly employed in this work
of publication. The Association has a capital of
about $82,000. Under God, it owes its prosperity
to the prudent management and untiring
energy of Eld. James White.</p>

<p>The <i>Advent Review</i> has at the present time
(Nov., 1873) a circulation of about 5000 copies.
The <i>Youth’s Instructor</i>, a monthly paper designed
for the children of Sabbath-keeping Adventists,
began to be issued in 1852, and has now
attained a circulation of nearly 5000 copies.</p>

<p>The <i>Advent Tidende</i>, a Danish monthly with
a circulation of 800, is published for the benefit
of those who speak the Danish and Norwegian
tongues, of whom a considerable number have
embraced the Sabbath.</p>

<p>The S. D. Adventists have taken a strong interest
in the subject of hygiene and the laws of
health, and have established a Health Institute
at Battle Creek, Mich., which publishes the
<i>Health Reformer</i>, a monthly journal, magazine
form, having a circulation of nearly 5000 copies.</p>

<p>Numerous publications on Prophecy, the Signs
of the Times, the Coming of Christ, the Sabbath,
the Law of God, the Sanctuary, &amp;c., &amp;c., have
been issued within the past twenty years, and
have had an extensive circulation, amounting, in
the aggregate, to many millions of pages.</p>

<p>The ordinary financial wants of the cause are
sustained by a method of collecting means known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[506]</span>
as Systematic Benevolence. By this system, it is
designed that each friend of the cause shall pay
a certain sum weekly proportioned to the property
which he possesses. But there is no compulsion
in this matter. In this manner the burden
is borne by all, so that it rests heavily upon
none; and the means needed for the work flows
with a steady stream into the treasury of the
several churches, and finally into that of the
State Conferences. A settlement is instituted
each year at the State Conferences, in which the
labors, receipts, and expenditures, of each minister
are carefully considered. Thus none are allowed
to waste means, and none who are recognized as
called of God to the ministry are allowed to suffer.</p>

<p>The churches sustain their meetings for the
most part without the aid of preaching. They
raise means to sustain the servants of Christ, but
bid them mainly devote their time and strength
to save those who have not the light of these important
truths shining upon their pathway. So
they go out everywhere preaching the word of
God, as his providence guides their feet. During
the summer months, the work in new fields is
carried forward principally by means of large
tents, which enable the preacher to provide a
suitable place of worship, wherever he may think
it desirable to labor.</p>

<p>The Seventh-day Adventists have thirteen
State Conferences, which assemble annually in
their respective States. These bear the names of
Maine, Vermont, New England, New York and
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri and Kansas,
and California. These Conferences are designed
to meet the local wants of the cause. There is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[507]</span>
also a General Conference, which assembles yearly,
composed of delegates from the State Conferences.
This Conference takes the general oversight of
the work in all the State Conferences, supplying
the more destitute with laborers as far as possible,
and uniting the whole strength of the body for
the accomplishment of the work. It also takes
the charge of missionary labor in those States
which have no organized Conferences.</p>

<p>There are about fifty ministers who devote
their whole time to the work of the gospel. There
is also a considerable number who preach a portion
of the time and devote the remainder to secular
labor. There are about 6000 members in the
several Conference organizations. But such is the
scattered condition of this people (for they are
found in all the northern States and in several
of the southern), that a very large portion have
no connection with its organization. They are
to be found in single families scattered all the
way from Maine to California and Oregon. The
<i>Review</i> and <i>Instructor</i> constitute, in a great
number of cases, the only preachers of their faith.</p>

<p>Those subjects which more especially interest
this people, are the fulfillment of prophecy, the
second personal advent of the Saviour as an
event now near at hand, immortality through
Christ alone, a change of heart through the operation
of the Holy Spirit, the observance of the
Sabbath of the fourth commandment, the divinity
and mediatorial work of Christ, and the development
of a holy character by obedience to
the perfect and holy law of God.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508"></a>[508]</span></p>

<p>They are very strict with regard to the ordinance
of baptism, believing not only that it requires
men to be buried in the watery grave, but
that even such baptism is faulty if administered
to those who are breaking one of the ten commandments.
They also believe that our Lord’s
direction in John 13 should be observed in connection
with the supper.</p>

<p>They teach that the gifts of the Spirit set forth
in 1 Cor. 12 and Eph. 4, were designed to remain
in the church till the end of time. They believe
that these were lost in consequence of the same
apostasy that changed the Sabbath. They also
believe that in the final restoration of the commandments
by the work of the third angel, the
gifts of the Spirit of God are restored with them.
So the remnant of the church, or last generation
of its members, is said to “keep the commandments
of God, and have the testimony of Jesus
Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> And the angel of God explains this by
saying, “The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
prophecy.”<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> The spirit of prophecy therefore
has a distinct place assigned to it in the final
work of Sabbath reform. Such are their views
of this portion of Scripture; and their history
from the beginning has been marked by the influence
of this sacred gift.</p>

<p>In the face of strong opposition, the people
known as Seventh-day Adventists have arisen to
bear their testimony for the Sabbath of the Lord.
They have had perils from open foes, and from
false brethren; but they have thus far overcome
the difficulties of the way, and from each have
gathered strength for the conflict before them.
They have a definite work which they hope to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509"></a>[509]</span>
accomplish. It is to make ready a people prepared
for the advent of the Lord.</p>

<p>Honorable mention should be made of the Seventh-day
Adventists of Switzerland. They first
learned these precious truths from Elder M. B.
Czechowski, who a few years since instructed
them in the commandments of God and the faith
of Jesus. Since his labors with them ceased,
God has given them strength to stand with firmness
for his truth, and has added to their numbers.
They have a heart to obey the truth and
to sacrifice for its advancement. They number
about sixty persons. There are a few individuals
of this faith also in Italy, Germany, and Denmark.</p>

<p>The observance of the Sabbath is sometimes
advocated on the ground that man needs a day
of rest and will grow prematurely old if he labor
seven days in each week, which is doubtless true;
and it has also been advocated on the ground
that God will bless in basket and in store those
who hallow his Sabbath, which may be true in
many cases; but the Bible does not urge motives
of this kind in respect to this sacred institution.
Without doubt there are great incidental advantages
in the observance of the Sabbath. But
these are not what God sets before us as the reasons
for its observance. The true reason is infinitely
higher than all considerations of this kind,
and should constrain men to obey, even were it
certain that it would cost them all that is dear
in the present life.</p>

<p>The Sabbath has been advocated on the ground
that it secures to men a day for divine worship
in which by common consent they may appear
before God. This is a very important consideration,
and yet the Bible says little concerning it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span>
It is one of the incidental blessings of the Sabbath,
and not the chief reason for its observance.
The Sabbath was ordained to commemorate the
creation of the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>The importance of the Sabbath as the memorial
of creation is that it keeps ever present the
true reason why worship is due to God. For the
worship of God is based upon the fact that he is
the Creator and that all other beings were created
by him. The Sabbath therefore lies at the very
foundation of divine worship, for it teaches this
great truth in the most impressive manner, and
no other institution does this. The true ground
of divine worship, not of that on the seventh
day merely, but of all worship, is found in the
distinction between the Creator and his creatures.
This great fact can never become obsolete, and
must never be forgotten. To keep it in man’s
mind, God gave to him the Sabbath. He received
it in his innocency, and notwithstanding the perversity
of his professed people, God has preserved
this sacred institution through the entire period
of man’s fallen state.</p>

<p>The four and twenty elders in the very act of
worshiping Him who sits upon the throne, state
the reason why worship is due to God:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor
and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy
pleasure they are and were created.”<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This great truth is therefore worthy to be remembered
even in the glorified state. And we
shall presently learn that what God gave to man
in Paradise, to keep this great truth before his
mind, shall be honored by him in Paradise restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span></p>

<p>The future is given to us in the prophetic
Scriptures. From them we learn that our earth
is reserved unto fire, and that from its ashes shall
spring new heavens and earth, and ages of endless
date.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> Over this glorified inheritance, the
second Adam, the Lord of the Sabbath, shall bear
rule, and under his gracious protection the nations
of them which are saved shall inherit the
land forever.<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> When the glory of the Lord shall
thus fill the earth as the waters cover the sea,
the Sabbath of the Most High is again and for
the last time brought to view:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will
make shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall
your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to
pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before
me, saith the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Does not Paul refer to these very facts set
forth by Isaiah when he says, “There remaineth
therefore a rest [Greek, <i>Sabbatismos</i>, literally “<span class="smcap">a
keeping of the sabbath</span>”] to the people of
God”?<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> The reason for this monthly gathering
to the New Jerusalem of all the host of the redeemed
from every part of the new earth may
be found in the language of the Apocalypse:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear
as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the
Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either
side of the river was there the tree of life, which bare
twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every
month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing
[literally, the service]<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> of the nations.”<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The gathering of the nations that are saved to
the presence of the Creator, from the whole face of
the new earth on each successive Sabbath, attests
the sacredness of the Sabbath even in that holy
state, and sets the seal of the Most High to the
perpetuity of this ancient institution.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Dr. Adam Clarke, in his Commentary on Gen. 1:1, uses the
following language: “Created] Caused that to exist which previously
to this moment, had no being. The rabbins, who are legitimate
judges in a case of verbal criticism on their own language,
are unanimous in asserting that the word <i>bara</i>, expresses the
commencement of the existence of a thing: or its egression from
nonentity to entity.... These words should be translated:
‘God in the beginning created the <i>substance</i> of the heavens and
the <i>substance</i> of the earth; <i>i. e.</i>, the <i>prima materia</i>, or first
elements, out of which the heavens and the earth were successively
formed.’”</p>

<p>Purchase’s Pilgrimage, b. i. chap, ii., speaks thus of the creation:
“Nothing but nothing had the Lord Almighty, whereof,
wherewith, whereby, to build this city” [that is the world].</p>

<p>Dr. Gill says: “These are said to be <i>created</i>, that is, to be
made out of nothing; for what pre-existent matter to this chaos
[of verse 2] could there be out of which they could be formed?”</p>

<p>“Creation must be the work of God, for none but an almighty
power could produce something out of nothing.” Commentary
on Gen. 1:1.</p>

<p>John Calvin, in his Commentary on this chapter, thus expounds
the creative act: “His meaning is, that the world was made out
of nothing. Hence the folly or those is refuted who imagine that
unformed matter existed from eternity.”</p>

<p>The work of creation is thus defined in 2 Maccabees 7:28:
“Look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and
consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was
mankind made likewise.”</p>

<p>That this creative act marked the commencement of the first day
instead of preceding it by almost infinite ages is thus stated in
2 Esdras 6:38: “And I said, O Lord, thou spakest from the beginning
of the creation, even the first day, and saidst thus: Let
heaven and earth be made; and thy word was a perfect work.”</p>

<p>Wycliffe’s translation, the earliest of the English versions,
renders Gen. 1:1, thus: “In the first, made God of naught heaven
and earth.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> Dr. Lange’s Commentary speaks on this point thus, in vol.
i, p. 197: “If we had no other passage than this of Gen. 2:3,
there would be no difficulty in deducing from it a precept for the
universal observance of a Sabbath, or seventh day, to be devoted
to God, as holy time, by all of that race for whom the earth and
its nature were specially prepared. The first men must have
known it. The words, ‘He hallowed it,’ can have no meaning
otherwise. They would be a blank unless in reference to some
who were required to keep it holy.”</p>

<p>Dr. Nicholas Bound, in his “True Doctrine of the Sabbath,”
London, 1606, page 7, thus states the antiquity of the Sabbath
precept:</p>

<p>“This first commandment of the Sabbath was no more then
first given when it was pronounced from Heaven by the Lord,
than any other one of the moral precepts, nay, that it hath so
much antiquity as the seventh day hath being; for, so soon as
the day was, so soon was it sanctified, that we might know
that, as it came in with the first man, so it must not go out but
with the last man; and as it was in the beginning of the world,
so it must continue to the end of the same; and, as the first seventh
day was sanctified, so must the last be. And this is that
which one saith, that the Sabbath was commanded by God, and
the seventh day was sanctified of him even from the beginning
of the world; where (the latter words expounding the former)
he showeth that, when God did sanctify it, then also he commanded
it to be kept holy; and therefore look how ancient the
sanctification of the day is, the same antiquity also as the commandment
of keeping it holy; for they two are all one.”</p>

begun some 2500 years after that event: “We read that when the
Ilienses, inhabitants of Ilium, called anciently by the name of
Troy, sent an embassage to Tiberius, to condole the death of his
father Augustus, he, considering the unseasonableness thereof, it
being a long time after his death, requited them accordingly, saying

<p><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="label">[64]</a> On this verse Dr. A. Clarke thus comments:—“<i>On the sixth
day they gathered twice as much</i>—This they did that they might
have a provision for the Sabbath.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> The Douay Bible reads: “To-morrow is the rest of the Sabbath
sanctified unto the Lord.” Dr. Clarke comments as follows
upon this text: “<i>To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath.</i>
There is nothing either in the text or context that seems to intimate
that the Sabbath was now <i>first</i> given to the Israelites, as
some have supposed; on the contrary, it is here spoken of as being
perfectly well known, from its having been generally observed.
The commandment, it is true, may be considered as being
now <i>renewed</i>; because they might have supposed, that in
their unsettled state in the wilderness, they might have been exempted
from the observance of it. Thus we find, 1. That when
God finished his creation he instituted the Sabbath; 2. When he
brought the people out of Egypt, he insisted on the strict observance
of it; 3. When he gave the <span class="smcap">law</span>, he made it a tenth part
of the whole: such importance has this institution in the eyes of
the Supreme Being!”</p>

<p>Richard Baxter, a famous divine of the seventeenth century,
and a decided advocate of the abrogation of the fourth commandment,
in his “Divine Appointment of the Lord’s Day,”
thus clearly states the origin of the Sabbath: “Why should God
begin two thousand years after [the creation of the world] to
give men a Sabbath upon the reason of his rest from the creation
of it, if he had never called man to that commemoration before?
And it is certain that the Sabbath was observed at the falling
of the manna before the giving of the law; and let any considering
Christian judge..... 1. Whether the not falling of
the manna, or the rest of God after the creation, was like to be
the original reason of the Sabbath. 2. And whether if it had
been the first, it would not have been said, Remember to keep
holy the Sabbath-day; for on six days the manna fell, and not on
the seventh; rather than ‘for in six days God created heaven
and earth, &amp;c., and rested the seventh day.’ And it is casually
added, ‘Wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath-day, and hallowed
it.’ Nay, consider whether this annexed reason intimates
not that the day on this ground being hallowed before, therefore
it was that God sent not down the manna on that day, and that
he prohibited the people from seeking it.”—<i>Practical Works</i>,

<p><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[68]</a> It has indeed been asserted that God by a miracle equalized
the portion of every one on five days, and doubled the portion of
each on the sixth, so that no act of the people had any bearing on
the Sabbath. But the equal portion of each on the five days was
not thus understood by Paul. He says: “But by an equality,
that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their
want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want;
that there may be equality; as it is written, He that had gathered
much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no
lack.” 2 Cor. 8:14, 15. And that the double portion on the
sixth day was the act of the people, is affirmed by Moses. He
says that “on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread.”

<p><a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> To this, however, it is objected that in consequence of the revolution
of the earth on its axis, the day begins earlier in the
East than with us; and hence that there is no definite seventh
day to the world of mankind. To suit such objectors, the earth
ought not to revolve. But in that case, so far from removing the
difficulty, there would be no seventh day at all; for one side of
the globe would have perpetual day and the other side perpetual
night. The truth is, everything depends upon the revolution of
the earth. God made the Sabbath for man [Mark 2:27]; he
made man to dwell on all the face of the earth [Acts 17:26]; he
caused the earth to revolve on its axis that it might measure off
the days of the week; causing that the sun should shine on the
earth, as it revolves from west to east, thus causing the day to go
round the world from east to west. Seven of these revolutions
constitute a week; the seventh one brings the Sabbath to all the
world.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_96" href="#FNanchor_96" class="label">[96]</a> Dr. Clarke has the following note on this verse: “It is very
likely that Moses went up into the mount on the first day of the
week; and having with Joshua remained in the region of the
cloud during six days, on the seventh, which was the Sabbath,
God spake to him.”—<i>Commentary on Ex.</i> 24:16. The marking
off of a week from the forty days in this remarkable manner
goes far toward establishing the view of Dr. C. And if this be
correct, it would strongly indicate that the ten commandments
were given upon the Sabbath; for there seems to be good evidence
that they were given the day before Moses went up to receive
the tables of stone. For the interview in which chapters
21-23 were given would require but a brief space, and certainly
followed immediately upon the giving of the ten commandments.
Ex. 20:18-21. When the interview closed, Moses came down to
the people and wrote all the words of the Lord. In the morning
he rose up early, and, having ratified the covenant, went up to
receive the law which God had written. Ex. 24:3-13.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106" class="label">[106]</a> As a sign it did not thereby become a shadow and a ceremony,
for the Lord of the Sabbath was himself a sign. “Behold,
I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for
signs and wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which
dwelleth in Mount Zion.” Isa. 8:18. In Heb. 2:13, this language
is referred to Christ. “And Simeon blessed them, and said unto
Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising
again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken
against.” Luke 2:34. That the Sabbath was a sign between
God and Israel throughout their generations, that is, for the
time that they were his peculiar people, no more proves that it is
now abolished than the fact that Jesus is now a sign that is
spoken against proves that he will cease to exist when he shall
no longer be such a sign. Nor does this language argue that the
Sabbath was made for them, or that its obligation ceased when
they ceased to be the people of God. For the prohibition against
eating blood was a perpetual statute for their generations; yet it
was given to Noah when God first permitted the use of animal
food, and was still obligatory upon the Gentiles when the apostles
turned to them. Lev. 3:17; Gen. 9:1-4; Acts 15.</p>

<p>The penalty of death at the hand of the civil magistrate is
affixed to the violation of the Sabbath. The same penalty is
affixed to most of the precepts of the moral law. Lev. 20:9, 10;
24:15-17; Deut. 13:6-18; 17:2-7. It should be remembered
that the moral law embracing the Sabbath formed a part of the
civil code of the Hebrew nation. As such, the great Law-giver
annexed penalties to be inflicted by the magistrate, thus doubtless
shadowing forth the final retribution of the ungodly. Such
penalties were suspended by that remarkable decision of the
Saviour that those who were without sin should cast the first
stone. But such a Being will arise to punish men, when the
hailstones of his wrath shall desolate the earth. Our Lord did
not, however, set aside the real penalty of the law, the wages of
sin, nor did he weaken that precept which had been violated.

<p><a id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="label">[111]</a> The idea has been suggested by some from this verse that
it was Moses and not God who wrote the second tables. This
view is thought to be strengthened by the previous verse: “Write
thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made
a covenant with thee and with Israel.” But it is to be observed
that the words upon the tables of stone were the ten commandments;
while the words here referred to were those which God
spoke to Moses during this interview of forty days, beginning
with verse 10 and extending to verse 27. That the pronoun <i>he</i> in
verse 28 might properly enough refer to Moses, if positive testimony
did not forbid such reference, is readily admitted. That it
is necessary to attend to the connection in deciding the antecedents
of pronouns, is strikingly illustrated in 2 Sam. 24:1, where
the pronoun <i>he</i> would naturally refer to the Lord, thus making
God the one who moved David to number Israel. Yet the connection
shows that this was not the case; for the anger of the
Lord was kindled by the act; and 1 Chron. 21:1, positively declares
that <i>he</i> who thus moved David was Satan. For positive
testimony that it was God and not Moses who wrote upon the second
tables, see Ex. 34:1; Deut. 10:1-5. These texts carefully
discriminate between the work of Moses and the work of God,
assigning the preparation of the tables, the carrying of them up
to the mount and the bringing of them down from the mount, to
Moses, but expressly assigning the writing on the tables to God
himself.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="label">[131]</a> The Bible abounds with facts which establish this proposition.
Thus the psalmist, in an address to Jerusalem, uses the following
language: “He giveth snow like wool; he scattereth the hoar-frost
like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels; who can
stand before his cold? He sendeth out his word, and melteth
them; he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. He
showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto
Israel.” Ps. 147:16-19. Dr. Clarke has the following note on
this text: “At particular times the cold in the East is so very intense
as to kill man and beast. <i>Jacobus de Vitriaco</i>, one of the
writers in the <i>Gesta Dei per Francos</i>, says that in an expedition
in which he was engaged against Mount Tabor, on the 24th of
December, the cold was so intense that many of the poor people,
and the beasts of burthen died by it. And <i>Albertus Aquensis</i>, another
of these writers, speaking of the cold in Judea, says that
<i>thirty</i> of the people who attended Baldwin I., in the mountainous
districts near the Dead Sea, were killed by it; and that in that
expedition they had to contend with horrible hail and ice; with
unheard of snow and rain. From this we find that the winters
are often very severe in Judea; and that in such cases as the
above we may well call out, Who can stand against his cold!”
See his commentary on Ps. 147. See also Jer. 36:22; John 18:18;
Matt. 24:20; Mark 13:18. 1 Maccabees 13:22, mentions a
very great snow storm in Palestine, so that horsemen could not
march.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">[132]</a> The testimony of the Bible on this point is very explicit. Thus
we read: “Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh
day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the
son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.” Ex.
23:12. To be without fire in the severity of winter would cause
the Sabbath to be a curse and not a refreshment. It would ruin
the health of those who should thus expose themselves, and render
the Sabbath anything but a source of refreshment. The
prophet uses the following language: “If thou turn away thy foot
from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day: and
call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable,” etc.
The Sabbath then was designed by God to be a source of delight
to his people, and not a cause of suffering. The merciful and beneficent
character of the Sabbath is seen in the following texts:
Matt. 12:10-13; Mark 2:27, 28; Luke 14:3-6. From them we
learn that God regards the sufferings of the brute creation, and
would have them alleviated upon the Sabbath; how much more
the distress and the needs of his people, for whose refreshment
and delight the Sabbath was made.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_136" href="#FNanchor_136" class="label">[136]</a> The law of the passover certainly contemplated the arrival of
the Hebrews in the promised land before its regular observance.
Ex. 12:25. Indeed, it was only once observed in the wilderness;
namely, in the year following their departure from Egypt; and
after that, was omitted until they entered the land of Canaan.
Num. 9; Josh. 5. This is proved, not merely from the fact that
no other instances are recorded, but because that circumcision
was omitted during the whole period of their sojourn in the wilderness;
and without this ordinance the children would have been
excluded from the passover. Ex. 12; Josh. 5.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137" class="label">[137]</a> Dr. Gill, who considered the seventh-day Sabbath as a Jewish
institution, beginning with Moses, and ending with Christ, and
one with which Gentiles have no concern, has given his judgment
concerning this question of fire on the Sabbath. He certainly
had no motive in this case to answer this popular objection only
that of stating the truth. He says:—</p>

<p>“This law seems to be a temporary one, and not to be continued,
nor is it said to be throughout their generations, as elsewhere,
where the law of the Sabbath is given or repeated; it is to
be restrained to the building of the tabernacle, and while that was
about to which it is prefaced; and it is designed to prevent all
public or private working on the Sabbath day in any thing belonging
to that;” etc.—<i>Commentary on Ex.</i> 35:3.</p>

<p>Dr. Bound gives us St. Augustine’s idea of this precept: “He
doth not admonish them of it without cause; for that he speaketh
in making the tabernacle, and all things belonging to it, and
showeth that, notwithstanding that, they must rest upon the Sabbath
day, and not under the color of that (as it is said in the text)
so much as kindle a fire.”—<i>True Doctrine of the Sabbath</i>, p. 140.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_139" href="#FNanchor_139" class="label">[139]</a> Lev. 23:3. It has been asserted from verse 2, that the Sabbath
was one of the feasts of the Lord. But a comparison of verses
2, 4, shows that there is a break in the narrative, for the purpose
of introducing the Sabbath as a holy convocation; and that verse
4 begins the theme anew in the very language of verse 2; and it
is to be observed that the remainder of the chapter sets forth the
actual Jewish feasts; viz., that of unleavened bread, the Pentecost,
and the feast of tabernacles. What further clears this point of
all obscurity is the fact that verses 37, 38, carefully discriminate
between the feasts of the Lord and the Sabbaths of the Lord. But
Ex. 23:14, settles the point beyond controversy: “Three times
thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.” And then verses
15-17 enumerate these feasts as in Lev. 23:4-44. See also 2
Chron. 8:13.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="label">[147]</a> Hengstenberg, a distinguished German Anti-Sabbatarian, thus
candidly treats this text: “A man who had gathered wood
on the Sabbath is brought forth at the command of the Lord, and
stoned by the whole congregation before the camp. Calvin says
rightly, ‘The guilty man did not fall through error, but through
gross contempt of the law, so that he treated it as a light matter
to overthrow and destroy all that is holy.’ It is evident from the
manner of its introduction that the account is not given with any
reference to its chronological position; it reads, ‘And while the
children of Israel were <i>in the wilderness</i>, they found a man that
gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day.’ It stands simply as an
example of the presumptuous breach of the law, of which the preceding
verses speak. He was one who despised the word of the
Lord and broke his commandments [verse 31]; one who with a
high hand sinned and reproached the Lord. Verse 30.”—<i>The

one kind of Sabbath was given to Adam, and one only remains
for us. See Hosea 2:11. ‘I will also cause all her mirth to cease,
her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn
feasts.’ All the Jewish sabbaths did cease when Christ nailed
them to his cross. Col. 2:14-17. These were properly called
Jewish sabbaths. Hosea says, ‘her sabbaths.’ But the Sabbath
of which we are speaking, God calls ‘my Sabbath.’ Here is a
clear distinction between the creation Sabbath and the ceremonial.
The one is perpetual; the others were merely shadows of good
things to come.”—<i>Life and Views</i>, pp. 161, 162.</p>

the following verses we find the ruin of the Jews attributed to the
breach of the Sabbath: as this led to a neglect of sacrifice, the
ordinances of religion, and all public worship; so it necessarily
brought with it all immorality. The breach of the Sabbath was
that which let in upon them all the waters of God’s wrath.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_232" href="#FNanchor_232" class="label">[232]</a> A few words relative to the time of beginning the Sabbath are
here demanded. 1. The reckoning of the first week of time necessarily
determines that of all succeeding weeks. The first division
of the first day was night; and each day of the first week began
with evening; the evening and the morning, an expression equivalent
to the night and the day, constituted the day of twenty-four
hours. Gen. 1. Hence, the first Sabbath began and ended with
evening. 2. That the night is in the Scriptures reckoned a part
of the day of twenty-four hours, is proved by many texts. Ex.
12:41, 42; 1 Sam. 26:7, 8; Luke 2:8-11; Mark 14:30; Luke
22:34, and many other testimonies. 3. The 2300 days, symbolizing
2300 years, are each constituted like the days of the first
week of time. Dan. 8:14. The margin, which gives the literal
Hebrew, calls each of these days an “evening morning.” 4.
The statute defining the great day of atonement is absolutely decisive
that the day begins with evening, and that the night is a
part of the day. Lev. 23:32. “It shall be unto you a Sabbath
of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the
month at even, from even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath.”
5. That evening is at sunset is abundantly proved by the
following scriptures: Deut. 16:6; Lev. 22:6, 7; Deut. 23:2; 24:13,
15; Josh. 8:29; 10:26, 27; Judges 14:18; 2 Sam. 3:35;
2 Chron. 18:34; Matt. 8:16; Mark 1:32; Luke 4:40. But does
not Neh. 13:19, conflict with this testimony, and indicate that
the Sabbath did not begin until after dark? I think not. The
text does not say, “When it began to be dark at Jerusalem before
the Sabbath,” but it says, “When the <i>gates</i> of Jerusalem began
to be dark.” If it be remembered that the gates of Jerusalem
were placed under wide and high walls, it will not be found
difficult to harmonize this text with the many here adduced,
which prove that the day begins with sunset.</p>

<p>Calmet, in his Bible Dictionary, article, Sabbath, thus states
the ancient Jewish method of beginning the Sabbath: “About
half an hour before the sunset all work is quitted and the Sabbath
is supposed to be begun.” He speaks thus of the close of the
Sabbath: “When night comes, and they can discern in the
heaven three stars of moderate magnitude, then the Sabbath is
ended, and they may return to their ordinary employments.”</p>

to one of those historical frauds by which Sunday is shown
to be the Sabbath. Dr. Justin Edwards states this case thus:
“Pompey, the Roman general, knowing this, when besieging
Jerusalem, would not attack them on the Sabbath; but spent the
day in constructing his works, and preparing to attack them on
Monday, and in a manner that they could not withstand, and so
he took the city.”—<i>Sabbath Manual</i>, p. 216. That is to say, the
next day after the Sabbath was Monday, and of course Sunday
was the Sabbath! Yet Dr. E. well knew that in Pompey’s time,
63 years before Christ, Saturday was the only weekly Sabbath,
and that Sunday and not Monday was the day of attack.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_287" href="#FNanchor_287" class="label">[287]</a> Thus remarks Mr. Crozier in the <i>Advent Harbinger</i> for Dec.
6, 1851: “The reference to the Sabbath in Matt. 24:20, only
shows that the Jews who rejected Christ would be keeping the
Sabbath at the destruction of Jerusalem, and would, in consequence,
add to the dangers of the disciples’ flight by punishing
them perhaps with death for fleeing on that day.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Marsh, forgetting that Christ forbade his disciples to
take anything with them in their flight, uses the following language:
“If the disciples should attempt to flee from Jerusalem
on that day and carry their things, the Jews would embarrass
their flight and perhaps put them to death. The Jews would be
keeping the Sabbath, because they rejected Christ and his gospel.”—<i>Advent
Harbinger</i>, Jan. 24, 1852. These quotations betray
the bitterness of their authors. In honorable distinction from these
anti-Sabbatarians, the following is quoted from Mr. William Miller,
himself an observer of the first day of the week:—</p>

<p>“‘Neither on the Sabbath day.’ Because it was to be kept as
a day of rest, and no servile work was to be done on that day,
nor would it be right for them to travel on that day. Christ has
in this place sanctioned the Sabbath, and clearly shows us our
duty to let no trivial circumstance cause us to break the law of
the Sabbath. Yet how many who profess to believe in Christ, at
this present day, make it a point to visit, travel, and feast, on this
day? What a false-hearted profession must that person make
who can thus treat with contempt the moral law of God, and despise
the precepts of the Lord Jesus! We may here learn our
obligation to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”—<i>Exposition
of Matt.</i> 24, p. 18.</p>

of the Sabbath we have in Matt. 24:20: ‘Pray ye that
your flight be not in the winter, <i>neither on the Sabbath day</i>.’
Christ is here speaking of the flight of the apostles and other
Christians out of Jerusalem and Judea, just before their final
destruction, as is manifest by the whole context, and especially
by the 16th verse: ‘Then let them which be in Judea flee into the
mountains.’ But this final destruction of Jerusalem was after the
dissolution of the Jewish constitution, and after the Christian dispensation
was fully set up. Yet it is plainly implied in these
words of our Lord, that even then Christians were bound to a
strict observation of the Sabbath.”—<i>Works of President Edwards</i>,
vol. iv. pp. 621, 622, New York, 1849.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_318" href="#FNanchor_318" class="label">[318]</a> When the resurrection day was “far spent,” the Saviour and
two of the disciples drew near to Emmaus, a village seven and a
half miles from Jerusalem. They constrained him to go in with
them to tarry for the night. While they were eating supper they
discovered that it was Jesus, when he vanished from their sight.
Then they arose and returned to Jerusalem; and after their arrival,
the first meeting of Jesus with the eleven took place. It
could not therefore have lacked but little of sunset, which closed
the day, if not actually upon the second day, when Jesus came
into their midst. Luke 24. In the latter case, the expression,
“the same day at evening being the first day of the week,” would
find an exact parallel in meaning, in the expression, “in the ninth
day of the month at even,” which actually signifies the evening
with which the tenth day of the seventh month commences. Lev.
23:32.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_325" href="#FNanchor_325" class="label">[325]</a> In 1633, William Prynne, a prisoner in the tower of London,
composed a work in defense of first-day observance, entitled,
“Dissertation on the Lord’s Day Sabbath.” He thus acknowledges
the futility of the argument under consideration: “No
scripture ... prefers or advanceth the work of redemption ...
before the work of creation; both these works being very great
and glorious in themselves; wherefore I cannot believe the work
of redemption, or Christ’s resurrection alone, to be more excellent
and glorious than the work of creation, without sufficient
texts and Scripture grounds to prove it; but may deny it as a
presumptuous fancy or unsound assertion, till satisfactorily
proved, as well as peremptorily averred without proof.”—Page
59. This is the judgment of a candid advocate of the first day as a
Christian festival. On Acts 20:7, he will be allowed to testify
again.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_388" href="#FNanchor_388" class="label">[388]</a> Prof. Hacket remarks on the length of this voyage: “The
passage on the apostle’s first journey to Europe occupied two
days only; see chapter 16:11. Adverse winds or calms would be
liable, at any season of the year, to occasion this variation.”—<i>Commentary
on Acts</i>, p. 329. This shows how little ground there
is to claim that Paul broke the Sabbath on this voyage. There
was ample time to reach Troas before the Sabbath when he
started from Philippi, had not providential causes hindered.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_394" href="#FNanchor_394" class="label">[394]</a> This fact has been acknowledged by many first-day commentators.
Thus Prof. Hacket comments upon this text: “The Jews
reckoned the day from evening to morning, and on that principle
the evening of the first day of the week would be our Saturday
evening. If Luke reckoned so here, as many commentators suppose,
the apostle then waited for the expiration of the Jewish
Sabbath, and held his last religious service with the brethren at
Troas, at the beginning of the Christian Sabbath, <i>i. e.</i>, on Saturday
evening, and consequently resumed his journey on Sunday
morning.”—<i>Commentary on Acts</i>, pp. 329, 330. But he endeavors
to shield the first-day Sabbath from this fatal admission
by suggesting that Luke probably reckoned time according to the
pagan method, rather than by that which is ordained in the
Scriptures!</p>

<p>Kitto, in noting the fact that this was an evening meeting,
speaks thus: “It has from this last circumstance been inferred
that the assembly commenced after sunset on the Sabbath, at
which hour the first day of the week had commenced, according
to the Jewish reckoning [Jahn’s Bibl. Antiq., sect. 398], which would
hardly agree with the idea of a commemoration of the resurrection.”—<i>Cyclopedia
of Biblical Literature</i>, article, Lord’s day.</p>

<p>And Prynne, whose testimony relative to redemption as an
argument for the change of the Sabbath has been already quoted,
thus states this point: “Because the text saith there were
many lights in the upper room where they were gathered together,
and that Paul preached from the time of their coming together
till midnight, ... this meeting of the disciples at Troas, and
Paul’s preaching to them, began at evening. The sole doubt will
be what evening this was.... For my own part I conceive clearly
that it was upon Saturday night, as we falsely call it, and not
the coming Sunday night.... Because St. Luke records that
it was upon the first day of the week when this meeting was ...
therefore it must needs be on the Saturday, not on our Sunday
evening, since the Sunday evening in St. Luke’s and the Scripture
account was no part of the first, but of the second day; the day
ever beginning and ending at evening.”</p>

<p>Prynne notices the objection drawn from the phrase, “ready to
depart on the morrow,” as indicating that this departure was not
on the same day of the week with his night meeting. The substance
of his answer is this: If the fact be kept in mind that the
days of the week are reckoned from evening to evening, the following
texts, in which in the night, the morning is spoken of as
the morrow, will show at once that another day of the week is not
necessarily intended by the phrase in question. 1 Sam. 19:11;
Esth. 2:14; Zeph. 3:3; Acts 23:31, 32.—<i>Diss. on Lord’s Day
Sab.</i>, pp. 36-41, 1633.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_407" href="#FNanchor_407" class="label">[407]</a> To show that Paul regarded Sabbatic observance as <i>dangerous</i>,
Gal. 4:10, is often quoted; notwithstanding the same individuals
claim that Rom. 14 proves that it is a matter of <i>perfect indifference</i>;
they not seeing that this is to make Paul contradict himself.
But if the connection be read from verse 8 to verse 11, it will be
seen that the Galatians before their conversion were not Jews, but
heathen: and that these days, months, times, and years, were not
those of the Levitical law, but those which they had regarded
with superstitious reverence while heathen. Observe the stress
which Paul lays upon the word “again,” in verse 9. And how
many that profess the religion of Christ at the present day superstitiously
regard certain days as “lucky” or “unlucky days;”
though such notions are derived only from heathen distinctions.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_410" href="#FNanchor_410" class="label">[410]</a> Dr. Bloomfield, though himself of a different opinion, speaks
thus of the views of others concerning the date of John’s gospel:
“It has been the general sentiment, both of ancient and modern
inquirers, that it was published about <i>the close of the first century</i>.”—<i>Greek
Testament with English Notes</i>, vol. i. p. 328.</p>

<p>Morer says that John “penned his gospel two years later than
the Apocalypse, and after his return from Patmos, as St. Augustine,
St. Jerome, and Eusebius, affirm.”—<i>Dialogues on the Lord’s
Day</i>, pp. 53, 54.</p>

<p>The Paragraph Bible of the London Religious Tract Society, in
its preface to the book of John, speaks thus: “According to the
general testimony of ancient writers, John wrote his gospel at
Ephesus, about the year 97.”</p>

<p>In support of the same view, see also Religious Encyclopedia,
Barnes’ Notes (gospels), Bible Dictionary, Cottage Bible, Domestic
Bible, Mine Explored, Union Bible Dictionary, Comprehensive
Bible, Dr. Hales, Horne, Nevins, Olshausen, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_411" href="#FNanchor_411" class="label">[411]</a> The Encyclopedia Britannica, in its article concerning the
Sabbath, undertakes to prove that the “religious observation of
the first day of the week is of apostolical appointment.” After
citing and commenting upon all the passages that could be urged
in proof of the point, it makes the following candid acknowledgment:
“Still, however, it must be owned that these passages are
not sufficient to prove the apostolical institution of the Lord’s day,
or even the actual observation of it.”</p>

<p>The absence of all scriptural testimony relative to the change
of the Sabbath, is accounted for by certain advocates of that theory,
not by the frank admission that it never was changed by the
Lord, but by quoting John 21:25, assuming the change of the
Sabbath as an undoubted truth, but that it was left out of the
Bible lest it should make that book too large! They think, therefore,
that we should go to Ecclesiastical history to learn this part
of our duty; not seeing that, as the fourth commandment still
stands in the Bible unrepealed and unchanged, to acknowledge
that that change must be sustained wholly outside of the Bible, is
to acknowledge that first-day observance is a tradition which
makes void the commandment of God. The following chapters
will, however, patiently examine the argument for first-day observance
drawn from ecclesiastical history.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_439" href="#FNanchor_439" class="label">[439]</a> The writer has prepared a small work entitled, “The Complete
Testimony of the Fathers of the first Three Centuries concerning
the Sabbath and First Day,” in which, with the single
exception of Origen, some of whose works were not at that time
accessible, every passage in the fathers which gives their views of
the Sabbath and first-day is presented. This pamphlet can be
had of the publishers of the present work for fifteen cents. To
save space in this History, a general statement of the doctrine of
the fathers is here made with brief quotations of their words.
But in “The Complete Testimony of the Fathers” every passage
is given in their own words, and to this little work the reader
is referred.</p>

given Maclaine’s translation, not because it is an accurate version
of Mosheim, but because it is so much used in support of the first-day
Sabbath. Maclaine in his preface to Mosheim says: “I have
sometimes taken considerable liberties with my author.” And
he tells us what these liberties were by saying that he had “often
added a few sentences, to render an observation more striking, a
fact more clear, a portrait more finished.” The present quotation
is an instance of these liberties. Dr. Murdock of New Haven
who has given “a close, literal version” of Mosheim, gives the
passage thus:—</p>

<p>“The Christians of this century, assembled for the worship of
God, and for their advancement in piety, on the first day of the
week, the day on which Christ reassumed his life: for that this
day was set apart for religious worship, by the apostles themselves,
and that, after the example of the church of Jerusalem, it
was generally observed, we have unexceptionable testimony.”—<i>Murdock’s
Mosheim</i>, cent. 1, part ii. chap. iv. sec. 4.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_465" href="#FNanchor_465" class="label">[465]</a> Neander’s Church History, translated by H. J. Rose, p. 186.
To break the force of this strong statement of Neander that “the
festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human
ordinance, and it was far from the intentions of the apostles
to establish a divine command in this respect, far from them, and
from the early apostolic church, to transfer the laws of the Sabbath
to Sunday,” two things have been said:—</p>

<p>1. That Neander, in a later edition of his work, retracted this
declaration. It is true that in re-writing his work he omitted this
sentence. But he inserted nothing of a contrary character, and
the general tenor of the revised edition is in this place precisely
the same as in that from which this out-spoken statement is taken.</p>

<p>In proof of this, we cite from the later edition of Neander his
statement in this very place of what constituted Sunday observance
in the early church. He says:—</p>

<p>“Sunday was distinguished as a day of joy, by being exempted
from fasts, and by the circumstance that prayer was performed
on this day in a standing and not in a kneeling posture, as
Christ, by his resurrection, had raised up fallen man again to
Heaven.”—<i>Torrey’s Neander</i>, vol. i. p. 295, ed. 1852.</p>

<p>This is an accurate account of early Sunday observance, as we
shall hereafter show; and that such observance was only a human
ordinance, of which no feature was ever commanded by the apostles,
will be very manifest to every person who attempts to find
any precept for any particular of it in the New Testament.</p>

<p>2. But the other method of setting aside this testimony of Neander
is to assert that he did not mean to deny that the apostles
established a divine command for Sunday as the Christian Sabbath,
but meant to assert that they did not establish a divine command
for Sunday as a Catholic festival! Those who make this
assertion must know that it is false. Neander expressly denies
that the apostles either constituted or recognized Sunday as a
Sabbath, and he represents Sunday as a mere festival from the
very first of its observance, and established only by human authority.</p>

when intended to refer to the Lord’s day, is never, I believe,
used without its substantive <i>dies</i> [day] being expressed. In all
the narratives contained in Ruinart’s <i>Acta Martyrum</i>, I find but
two instances of mention being made of the Lord’s day, and in
both these instances the substantive <i>dies</i> [day] is expressed.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_506" href="#FNanchor_506" class="label">[506]</a> This testimony is certainly decisive. It is the interpretation
of the compiler of the <i>Acta Martyrum</i>, himself, and is given with
direct reference to the particular instance under discussion. An
independent confirmation of Domville’s authorities, may be found
in Lucius’s Eccl. Hist., cent. 4, chap, vi.: “Fit mentio aliquoties
locorum istorum in quibus convenerint Christiani, in historia
persecutionis sub Diocletiano &amp; Maximino. Et apparet, ante
Constantinum etiam, locos eos fuisse mediocriter exstructos atque
exornatos: quos seu Templa appellarunt seu Dominica; ut apud
Eusebium (li. 9, c. 10) &amp; Ruffinum (li. 1, c. 3).”</p>

<p>It is certain that <i>Dominicum</i> is here used as designating a place
of divine worship. Dr. Twisse in his “Morality of the Fourth
Commandment,” p. 122, says: “The ancient fathers, both Greek
and Latin, called temples by the name of dominica and κυρίακα.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_513" href="#FNanchor_513" class="label">[513]</a> To break the force of Domville’s statement in which he exposes
the story originally told by Bishop Andrews as coming from
the <i>Acta Martyrum</i>, it is said that Domville used Ruinart’s <i>Acta
Martyrum</i>, and that Ruinart was not born till thirty-one years
after Bishop Andrews’ death, so that Domville did not go to the
same book that was used by the bishop, and therefore failed to
find what he found. Those who raise this point betray their ignorance
or expose their dishonesty. The <i>Acta Martyrum</i> is a
collection of the memoirs of the martyrs, written by their friends
from age to age. Ruinart did not write a new work, but simply
edited “the most valued collection” of these memoirs that has
ever appeared. See McClintock and Strong’s Cyclopedia, vol.
i. pp. 56, 57. Domville used Ruinart’s edition, because, as he
expresses it, it is “the most complete collection of the memoirs
and legends still extant, relative to the lives and sufferings of
the Christian martyrs.” Domville’s use of Ruinart was, therefore,
in the highest degree just and right.</p>

Hist. Sab. part ii. chap. v. sect. 1. Dr. Twisse, however,
asserts that the pope speaks of two classes. He gives Gregory’s
words as follows: “Relation is made unto me that certain men
of a perverse spirit, have sowed among you some corrupt doctrines
contrary to our holy faith; so as to forbid any work to be
done on the Sabbath day: these men we may well call the preachers
of Antichrist.... Another report was brought unto me;
and what was that? That some perverse persons preach among
you, that on the Lord’s day none should be washed. This is
clearly another point maintained by other persons, different from
the former.”—<i>Morality of the Fourth Commandment</i>, pp. 19, 20.
If Dr. Twisse is right, the Sabbath-keepers in Rome about the
year 600 were not chargeable with the Sunday observance above
mentioned.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_887" href="#FNanchor_887" class="label">[887]</a> Mr. Jones, in his “Church History,” vol. i. chap. iii., note at
the end of the chapter, explains this charge as follows: “But
this calumny is easily accounted for. The advocates of popery,
to support their usurpations and innovations in the kingdom of
Christ, were driven to the Old Testament for authority, adducing
the kingdom of David for their example. And when their adversaries
rebutted the argument, insisting that the parallel did not
hold, for that the kingdom of Christ, which is not of this world,
is a very different state of things from the kingdom of David,
their opponents accused them of giving up the divine authority of
the Old Testament.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_978" href="#FNanchor_978" class="label">[978]</a> In fact, the story told by Twisse that Barclay is not to be believed
in what he says of Calvin because he was treacherous toward
King James I., who for that reason would not promote him at his
court, appears to be wholly unfounded. The Encyclopedia
Britannica, vol. iv., p. 439, eighth edition, assigns a very different
reason. It says: “In those days a pension bestowed upon a Scottish
papist would have been numbered among the national grievances.”
That is to say, public opinion would not then tolerate the
promotion of a Romanist. But this writer believes that the king
secretly favored Barclay. Thus on page 440 he adds: “Although
it does not appear that he obtained any regular provision from
the king, we may perhaps suppose that he at least received occasional
gratuities.” This writer knew nothing of Barclay as a detected
spy at the king’s court. Of his standing as a man, he says
on p. 441: “If there had been any remarkable blemish in the
morals of Barclay, some of his numerous adversaries would have
pointed it out.” M’Clintock and Strong’s Cyclopedia, vol. 1, p.
663, says that he “would doubtless have succeeded at court had
he not been a Romanist.” See also Knight’s Cyclopedia of Biography,
article Barclay.</p>

Rachel D. Harris. At the age of seventeen, she was converted
and soon after joined the Methodist church. After her marriage,
she removed with her husband to central New York. There, at
the age of twenty-eight, she became an observer of the Bible Sabbath.
The Methodist minister, her pastor, did what he could to
turn her from the Sabbath, but finally told her she might keep it
if she would not leave them. But she was faithful to her convictions
of duty and united with the first Seventh-day Baptist church
of Verona, Oneida Co., N. Y. Her first husband bore the name
of Oaks; her second, that of Preston. She and her daughter, Delight
Oaks, were members of the first Verona church at the time
of their removal to Washington, N. H. The mother died Feb. 1,
1868; the daughter, several years earlier.</p>

Liddell and Scott define <i>Sabbatismos</i> “a keeping of the Sabbath.”
They give no other definition, but derive it from the verb <i>Sabbatizo</i>,
which they define by these words only, “to keep the Sabbath.”
Schrevelius defines <i>Sabbatismos</i> by this one phrase:
“Observance of the Sabbath.” He also derives it from <i>Sabbatizo</i>.
<i>Sabbatismos</i> is therefore the noun in Greek which signifies
the <i>act of Sabbath-keeping</i>, while <i>Sabbatizo</i>, from which it is derived,
is the verb which expresses that act.</p>

the Week.</span> By Elder J. N. Andrews. This work contains
an outline of the history of the Sabbath for the period
of Six Thousand years. Part First is the Biblical

with most careful and patient study. In all cases of
quotations from secular history, book, chapter, and page
are given. And book, chapter, and verse are given of all
quotations from the word of God.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Sanctuary and 2300 Days of Dan. 8:14.</span> By
Elder U. Smith. This question has developed the people
known as Seventh-day Adventists, and is the pivotal
doctrine upon which their applications of prophecy largely
depend. It explains the past Advent movement, shows
why those who looked for the Lord in 1844 were disappointed,
reveals the fact so essential to be understood,
that no prophetic period reaches to the second coming of
Christ, and shows where we are, and what we are to expect
in the future. A knowledge of this subject is indispensable
to a correct application of the more important
prophecies pertaining to the present time.</p>
